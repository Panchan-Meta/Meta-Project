ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN" Previous - Next Article 5 "HE DESCENDED INTO HELL. ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN" 631 Jesus "descended into the lower parts of the earth. He who descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens." 475 The Apostles' Creed confesses in the same article Christ's descent into hell and his Resurrection from the dead on the third day, because in his Passover it was precisely out of the depths of death that he made life spring forth: Christ, that Morning Star, who came back from the dead, and shed his peaceful light on all mankind, your Son who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
