PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS CHAPTER TWO YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF Article 10 THE TENTH COMMANDMENT IN BRIEF Previous - Next IN BRIEF 2551 "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Mt 6:21). 2552 The tenth commandment forbids avarice arising from a passion for riches and their attendant power. 2553 Envy is sadness at the sight of another's goods and the immoderate desire to have them for oneself. It is a capital sin. 2554 The baptized person combats envy through good-will, humility, and abandonment to the providence of God. 2555 Christ's faithful "have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires" (Gal 5:24); they are led by the Spirit and follow his desires. 2556 Detachment from riches is necessary for entering the Kingdom of heaven. "Blessed are the poor in spirit." 2557 "I want to see God" expresses the true desire of man. Thirst for God is quenched by the water of eternal life (cf In 4:14).
