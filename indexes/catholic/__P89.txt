PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS CHAPTER TWO YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF Article 7 THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT Previous - Next Article 7 THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT You shall not steal. 185 2401 The seventh commandment forbids unjustly taking or keeping the goods of one's neighbor and wronging him in any way with respect to his goods. It commands justice and charity in the care of earthly goods and the fruits of men's labor. For the sake of the common good, it requires respect for the universal destination of goods and respect for the right to private property. Christian life strives to order this world's goods to God and to fraternal charity. 185 EX 20:15; Deut 5:19; Mt 19:18. Previous - Next Copyright © Libreria Editrice Vaticana
