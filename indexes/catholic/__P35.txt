PART TWO: THE CELEBRATION OF THE CHRISTIAN MYSTERY SECTION ONE THE SACRAMENTAL ECONOMY CHAPTER ONE THE PASCHAL MYSTERY IN THE AGE OF THE CHURCH Article 2 THE PASCHAL MYSTERY IN THE CHURCH'S SACRAMENTS IN BRIEF Previous - Next IN BRIEF 1131 The sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. the visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions. 1132 The Church celebrates the sacraments as a priestly community structured by the baptismal priesthood and the priesthood of ordained ministers. 1133 The Holy Spirit prepares the faithful for the sacraments by the Word of God and the faith which welcomes that word in well-disposed hearts. Thus the sacraments strengthen faith and express it. 1134 The fruit of sacramental life is both personal and ecclesial. For every one of the faithful an the one hand, this fruit is life for God in Christ Jesus; for the Church, on the other, it is an increase in charity and in her mission of witness.
