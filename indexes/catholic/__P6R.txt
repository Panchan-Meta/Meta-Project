PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST SECTION ONE MAN'S VOCATION LIFE IN THE SPIRIT CHAPTER TWO THE HUMAN COMMUNION Article 3 SOCIAL JUSTICE IN BRIEF Previous - Next IN BRIEF 1943 Society ensures social justice by providing the conditions that allow associations and individuals to obtain their due. 1944 Respect for the human person considers the other "another self." It presupposes respect for the fundamental rights that flow from the dignity intrinsic of the person. 1945 The equality of men concerns their dignity as persons and the rights that flow from it. 1946 The differences among persons belong to God's plan, who wills that we should need one another. These differences should encourage charity. 1947 The equal dignity of human persons requires the effort to reduce excessive social and economic inequalities. It gives urgency to the elimination of sinful inequalities. 1948 Solidarity is an eminently Christian virtue. It practices the sharing of spiritual goods even more than material ones.
