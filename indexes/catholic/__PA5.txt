PART FOUR: CHRISTIAN PRAYER SECTION TWO THE LORD'S PRAYER Article 2 "OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN" IN BRIEF Previous - Next IN BRIEF 2797 Simple and faithful trust, humble and joyous assurance are the proper dispositions for one who prays the Our Father. 2798 We can invoke God as "Father" because the Son of God made man has revealed him to us. Jn this Son, through Baptism, we are incorporated and adopted as sons of God. 2799 The Lord's Prayer brings us into communion with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. At the same time it reveals us to ourselves (cf GS 22 # 1). 2800 Praying to our Father should develop in us the will to become like him and foster in us a humble and trusting heart. 2801 When we say "Our" Father, we are invoking the new covenant in Jesus Christ, communion with the Holy Trinity, and the divine love which spreads through the Church to encompass the world. 2802 "Who art in heaven" does not refer to a place but to God's majesty and his presence in the hearts of the just. Heaven, the Father's house, is the true homeland toward which we are heading and to which, already, we belong. Previous - Next Copyright © Libreria Editrice Vaticana
