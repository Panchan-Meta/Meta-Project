PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS CHAPTER TWO YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF Article 8 THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT Previous - Next Article 8 THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. 252 It was said to the men of old, "You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn." 253 2464 The eighth commandment forbids misrepresenting the truth in our relations with others. This moral prescription flows from the vocation of the holy people to bear witness to their God who is the truth and wills the truth. Offenses against the truth express by word or deed a refusal to commit oneself to moral uprightness: they are fundamental infidelities to God and, in this sense, they undermine the foundations of the covenant. 252 EX 20:16; Cf.
