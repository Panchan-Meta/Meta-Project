PART FOUR: CHRISTIAN PRAYER SECTION TWO THE LORD'S PRAYER Article 1 "THE SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE GOSPEL" IN BRIEF Previous - Next IN BRIEF 2773 In response to his disciples' request "Lord, teach us to pray" (Lk 11:1), Jesus entrusts them with the fundamental Christian prayer, the Our Father. 2774 "The Lord's Prayer is truly the summary of the whole gospel," 24 The "most perfect of prayers." 25 It is at the center of the Scriptures. 2775 It is called "the Lord's Prayer" because it comes to us from the Lord Jesus, the master and model of our prayer. 2776 The Lord's Prayer is the quintessential prayer of the Church. It is an integral part of the major hours of the Divine Office and of the sacraments of Christian initiation: Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist. Integrated into the Eucharist it reveals the eschatological character of its petitions, hoping for the Lord, "until he comes" (1 Cor 11:26). 24 Tertullian, De orat. 1 PL 1, 1251-1255. 25 St. Thomas Aquinas, STh II-II, 83, 9.
