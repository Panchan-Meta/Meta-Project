CHAPTER 10
Destruction of Idolatrous Cultic Objects
1
a
Israel is a luxuriant vine
whose fruit matches its growth.
The more abundant his fruit,
the more altars he built;
The more productive his land,
the more sacred pillars
*
he set up.
2
Their heart is false!
Now they will pay for their guilt:
God will break down their altars
and destroy their sacred pillars.
3
For now they will say,
“We have no king!
*
Since we do not fear the L
ORD
,
the king—what could he do for us?”
4
They make promises,
swear false oaths, and make covenants,
While lawsuits sprout
like poisonous weeds
*
in the furrows of a field!
5
The inhabitants of Samaria are afraid
for the calf of Beth-aven;
*
Its people mourn for it
and its idolatrous priests wail over it,
—over its glory which has departed from it.
b
6
It too will be carried to Assyria,
as an offering to the great king.
*
c
Ephraim will be put to shame,
Israel will be shamed by his schemes.
7
Samaria and her king will disappear,
like a twig upon the waters.
8
The high places of Aven
*
will be destroyed,
the sin of Israel;
thorns and thistles will overgrow their altars.
Then they will cry out to the mountains, “Cover us!”
and to the hills, “Fall upon us!”
d
War Because of Israel’s Wickedness
9
Since the days of Gibeah
e
you have sinned, Israel.
There they took their stand;
will war not reach them in Gibeah?
Against a perverse people
10
I came and I chastised them;
Peoples will be gathered against them
when I bind them to their two crimes.
*
11
Ephraim was a trained heifer,
that loved to thresh;
I myself laid a yoke
upon her beautiful neck;
I will make Ephraim break ground, Judah must plow,
Jacob must harrow for himself:
12
“Sow for yourselves justice,
reap the reward of loyalty;
Break up for yourselves a new field,
f
for it is time to seek the L
ORD
,
till he comes and rains justice upon you.”
g
13
But you have plowed wickedness,
reaped perversity,
and eaten the fruit of falsehood.
Because you have trusted in your own power,
and in your many warriors,
h
14
The clamor of war shall break out among your people
and all your fortresses shall be ravaged
As Salman ravaged Beth-arbel
*
on the day of war,
smashing mothers along with their children.
i
15
So it will be done to you, Bethel,
because of your utter wickedness:
At dawn
*
the king of Israel
will utterly disappear.
* [
10:1
]
Sacred pillars
: see note on
3:4
.
* [
10:3
]
No king
: the instability of the monarchy (
7:3
–
7
) and its vassalage to foreign kings (
7:8
–
16
) render the monarchy ineffective. The kings do the opposite of what they are supposed to do (
10:4
).
* [
10:4
]
Lawsuits…like poisonous weeds
: the administration of justice, which should have been the mainstay of the people, has in corrupt hands become another instrument of oppression; cf.
Am 6:12
.
* [
10:5
]
The calf of Beth-aven
: see note on
4:15
.
* [
10:6
]
The great king
: a title used by the Assyrian kings. See also note on
5:13
.
* [
10:8
]
Aven
: wickedness, first of all at Bethel (v.
5
), but also at all the high places.
* [
10:10
]
Two crimes
: the allusion is not clear; a possible reference is the outrage described in
Jgs 19
.
* [
10:14
]
As Salman ravaged Beth-arbel
: perhaps Salamanu, king of Moab, mentioned in an inscription of Tiglath-pileser III, after an invasion in Gilead (Transjordan), where there was a Beth-arbel, close to present Irbid.
* [
10:15
]
At dawn
: normally the moment of God’s victory over Israel’s enemies, and thus his salvation (
Is 17:14
;
Ps 46:6
). Here it is a reversal of this expectation.
