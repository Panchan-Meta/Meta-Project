CHAPTER 2
The Visit of the Magi.
*
1
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod,
*
behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
2
saying, “Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star
*
at its rising and have come to do him homage.”
a
3
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
4
Assembling all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.
*
5
b
They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet:
6
‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,
are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;
since from you shall come a ruler,
who is to shepherd my people Israel.’”
7
Then Herod called the magi secretly and ascertained from them the time of the star’s appearance.
8
He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search diligently for the child. When you have found him, bring me word, that I too may go and do him homage.”
9
After their audience with the king they set out. And behold, the star that they had seen at its rising preceded them, until it came and stopped over the place where the child was.
10
They were overjoyed at seeing the star,
11
*
c
and on entering the house they saw the child with Mary his mother. They prostrated themselves and did him homage. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
12
And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their country by another way.
The Flight to Egypt.
13
*
When they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, flee to Egypt,
*
and stay there until I tell you. Herod is going to search for the child to destroy him.”
14
Joseph rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt.
15
*
He stayed there until the death of Herod, that what the Lord had said through the prophet
d
might be fulfilled, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
The Massacre of the Infants.
16
When Herod realized that he had been deceived by the magi, he became furious. He ordered the massacre of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had ascertained from the magi.
17
Then was fulfilled what had been said through Jeremiah the prophet:
18
*
e
“A voice was heard in Ramah,
sobbing and loud lamentation;
Rachel weeping for her children,
and she would not be consoled,
since they were no more.”
The Return from Egypt.
19
When Herod had died, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
20
and said,
f
“Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.”
*
21
He rose, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
22
But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod,
*
he was afraid to go back there. And because he had been warned in a dream, he departed for the region of Galilee.
23
*
g
He went and dwelt in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, “He shall be called a Nazorean.”
* [
2:1
–
12
] The future rejection of Jesus by Israel and his acceptance by the Gentiles are retrojected into this scene of the narrative.
* [
2:1
]
In the days of King Herod
: Herod reigned from 37 to 4 B.C.
Magi
: originally a designation of the Persian priestly caste, the word became used of those who were regarded as having more than human knowledge. Matthew’s magi are astrologers.
* [
2:2
]
We saw his star
: it was a common ancient belief that a new star appeared at the time of a ruler’s birth. Matthew also draws upon the Old Testament story of Balaam, who had prophesied that “A star shall advance from Jacob” (
Nm 24:17
), though there the star means not an astral phenomenon but the king himself.
* [
2:4
] Herod’s consultation with the chief priests and scribes has some similarity to a Jewish legend about the child Moses in which the “sacred scribes” warn Pharaoh about the imminent birth of one who will deliver Israel from Egypt and the king makes plans to destroy him.
* [
2:11
] Cf.
Ps 72:10
,
15
;
Is 60:6
. These Old Testament texts led to the interpretation of the magi as kings.
* [
2:13
–
23
] Biblical and nonbiblical traditions about Moses are here applied to the child Jesus, though the dominant Old Testament type is not Moses but Israel (
Mt 2:15
).
* [
2:13
]
Flee to Egypt
: Egypt was a traditional place of refuge for those fleeing from danger in Palestine (see
1 Kgs 11:40
;
Jer 26:21
), but the main reason why the child is to be taken to Egypt is that he may relive the Exodus experience of Israel.
* [
2:15
] The fulfillment citation is taken from
Hos 11:1
. Israel, God’s son, was called out of Egypt at the time of the Exodus; Jesus, the Son of God, will similarly be called out of that land in a new exodus. The father-son relationship between God and the nation is set in a higher key. Here the son is not a group adopted as “son of God,” but the child who, as conceived by the holy Spirit, stands in unique relation to God. He is son of David and of Abraham, of Mary and of Joseph, but, above all, of God.
* [
2:18
]
Jer 31:15
portrays Rachel, wife of the patriarch Jacob, weeping for her children taken into exile at the time of the Assyrian invasion of the northern kingdom (722–21 B.C.). Bethlehem was traditionally identified with Ephrath, the place near which Rachel was buried (see
Gn 35:19
;
48:7
), and the mourning of Rachel is here applied to her lost children of a later age.
Ramah
: about six miles north of Jerusalem. The lamentation of Rachel is so great as to be heard at a far distance.
* [
2:20
]
For those who sought the child’s life are dead
: Moses, who had fled from Egypt because the Pharaoh sought to kill him (see
Ex 2:15
), was told to return there, “for all the men who sought your life are dead” (
Ex 4:19
).
* [
2:22
] With the agreement of the emperor Augustus, Archelaus received half of his father’s kingdom, including Judea, after Herod’s death. He had the title “ethnarch” (i.e., “ruler of a nation”) and reigned from 4 B.C. to A.D. 6.
* [
2:23
]
Nazareth…he shall be called a Nazorean
: the tradition of Jesus’ residence in Nazareth was firmly established, and Matthew sees it as being in accordance with the foreannounced plan of God. The town of Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament, and no such prophecy can be found there. The vague expression “through the prophets” may be due to Matthew’s seeing a connection between Nazareth and certain texts in which there are words with a remote similarity to the name of that town. Some such Old Testament texts are
Is 11:1
where the Davidic king of the future is called “a bud” (
nēser
) that shall blossom from the roots of Jesse, and
Jgs 13:5
,
7
where Samson, the future deliverer of Israel from the Philistines, is called one who shall be consecrated (a
nāzîr
) to God.
