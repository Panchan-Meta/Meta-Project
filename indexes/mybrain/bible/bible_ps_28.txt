PSALM 28
*
Petition and Thanksgiving
1
Of David.
I
To you, L
ORD
, I call;
my Rock, do not be deaf to me,
a
Do not be silent toward me,
so that I join those who go down to the pit.
b
2
Hear the sound of my pleading when I cry to you for help
when I lift up my hands toward your holy place.
*
c
3
Do not drag me off with the wicked,
with those who do wrong,
d
Who speak peace to their neighbors
though evil is in their hearts.
e
4
Repay them for their deeds,
for the evil that they do.
For the work of their hands repay them;
give them what they deserve.
f
5
Because they do not understand the L
ORD
’s works,
the work of his hands,
g
He will tear them down,
never to rebuild them.
II
6
*
Blessed be the L
ORD
,
who has heard the sound of my pleading.
7
The L
ORD
is my strength and my shield,
in whom my heart trusts.
I am helped, so my heart rejoices;
with my song I praise him.
III
8
*
L
ORD
, you are a strength for your people,
the saving refuge of your anointed.
9
Save your people, bless your inheritance;
pasture and carry them forever!
* [
Psalm 28
] A lament asking that the psalmist, who has taken refuge in the Temple (
Ps 28:2
), not be punished with the wicked, who are headed inevitably toward destruction (
Ps 28:1
,
3
–
5
). The statement of praise is exceptionally lengthy and vigorous (
Ps 28:6
–
7
). The Psalm ends with a prayer (
Ps 28:8
–
9
).
* [
28:2
]
Your holy place
: the innermost part of the Temple, the holy of holies, containing the ark, cf.
1 Kgs 6:16
,
19
–
23
;
8:6
–
8
.
* [
28:6
] The psalmist shifts to fervent thanksgiving, probably responding to a priestly or prophetic oracle in
Ps 28:5cd
(not usually transmitted) assuring the worshiper that the prayer has been heard.
* [
28:8
]
Your peopleâ€¦your anointed
: salvation is more than individual, affecting all the people and their God-given leader.
