CHAPTER 8
Seven Oracles: Judah and Zion Restored.
1
Then the word of the L
ORD
of hosts came:
2
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
I am intensely jealous for Zion,
a
stirred to jealous wrath for her.
3
Thus says the L
ORD
:
I have returned to Zion,
and I will dwell within Jerusalem;
Jerusalem will be called the faithful city,
*
b
and the mountain of the L
ORD
of hosts, the holy mountain.
4
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of old age.
c
5
The city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.
6
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
Even if this should seem impossible in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it seem impossible in my eyes also?
d
—oracle of the L
ORD
of hosts.
7
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
I am going to rescue my people from the land of the rising sun, and from the land of the setting sun.
8
I will bring them back to dwell within Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God,
e
in faithfulness and justice.
9
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
Let your hands be strong, you who now hear these words which were spoken by the prophets when the foundation of the house of the L
ORD
of hosts was laid
*
for the building of the temple.
f
10
For before those days, there were no wages for people, nor hire for animals. Those who came and went were not safe from the enemy, for I set neighbor against neighbor.
11
But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in former days—oracle of the L
ORD
of hosts.
12
For there will be a sowing of peace:
the vine will yield its fruit,
the land will yield its crops,
and the heavens
*
will yield their dew.
I will give all these things to the remnant of this people to possess.
13
Just as you became a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you that you may be a blessing.
g
Do not fear; let your hands be strong.
14
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
Just as I intended to harm you when your ancestors angered me—says the L
ORD
of hosts—and I did not relent,
15
so again in these days I intend to favor Jerusalem and the house of Judah; do not fear!
16
These then are the things you must do: Speak the truth to one another;
h
judge with honesty and complete justice in your gates.
*
i
17
Let none of you plot evil against another in your heart, nor love a false oath. For all these things I hate—oracle of the L
ORD
.
Three Oracles: Judah and the Nations.
18
The word of the L
ORD
of hosts came to me:
19
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
The fast days of the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, and the tenth months
*
j
will become occasions of joy and gladness, and happy festivals for the house of Judah.
k
So love faithfulness and peace!
20
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
There will yet come peoples and inhabitants of many cities;
l
21
and the inhabitants of one city will approach those of another, and say, “Come! let us go to implore the favor of the L
ORD
and to seek the L
ORD
of hosts. I too am going.”
22
Many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the L
ORD
of hosts in Jerusalem and to implore the favor of the L
ORD
.
23
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
In those days ten people from nations of every language will take hold,
m
yes, will take hold of the cloak of every Judahite and say, “Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”

Faithful city
: a unique biblical epithet for Jerusalem, signaling the importance of the holy city and its leaders for establishing justice in society (see also vv.
8
,
16
,
19
).
Holy mountain
: Jerusalem and its Temple, the sacred center of the holy land (
2:16
) and of the whole world.
* [
8:9
]
When the foundation…was laid
: December 18, 520 B.C., the date of the Temple refoundation ceremony, marking the beginning of the project to restore the Temple (see
Hg 2:10
,

,
20
).
* [

Hg 1:10
.

Fast days of the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, and the tenth months
: all these fast days were probably held in connection with Jerusalem’s demise. The fasts of the fourth month (commemorating the departure of Judahite leadership from Jerusalem,
2 Kgs 25:3
–
7
) and of the tenth month (marking the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem,
2 Kgs 25:1
) were added to the fasts of the fifth and seventh months mentioned in
Zec 7:3
and
5
(see notes).
