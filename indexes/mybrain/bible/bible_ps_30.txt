PSALM 30
*
Thanksgiving for Deliverance
1
A psalm. A song for the dedication of the Temple.
*
Of David.
I
2
I praise you, L
ORD
, for you raised me up
and did not let my enemies rejoice over me.
3
O L
ORD
, my God,
I cried out to you for help and you healed
*
me.
4
L
ORD
, you brought my soul up from Sheol;
you let me live, from going down to the pit.
*
a
II
5
Sing praise to the L
ORD
, you faithful;
give thanks to his holy memory.
6
For his anger lasts but a moment;
his favor a lifetime.
At dusk weeping comes for the night;
but at dawn there is rejoicing.
III
7
Complacent,
*
I once said,
“I shall never be shaken.”
8
L
ORD
, you showed me favor,
established for me mountains of virtue.
But when you hid your face
I was struck with terror.
b
9
To you, L
ORD
, I cried out;
with the Lord I pleaded for mercy:
10
*
“What gain is there from my lifeblood,
from my going down to the grave?
Does dust give you thanks
or declare your faithfulness?
11
Hear, O L
ORD
, have mercy on me;
L
ORD
, be my helper.”
IV
12
You changed my mourning into dancing;
you took off my sackcloth
and clothed me with gladness.
c
13
So that my glory may praise you
and not be silent.
O L
ORD
, my God,
forever will I give you thanks.
* [
Psalm 30
] An individual thanksgiving in four parts: praise and thanks for deliverance and restoration (
Ps 30:2
–
4
); an invitation to others to join in (
Ps 30:5
–
6
); a flashback to the time before deliverance (
Ps 30:7
–
11
); a return to praise and thanks (
Ps 30:12
). Two sets of images recur: 1) going down, death, silence; 2) coming up, life, praising. God has delivered the psalmist from one state to the other.
* [
30:1
]
For the dedication of the Temple
: a later adaptation of the Psalm to celebrate the purification of the Temple in 164 B.C. during the Maccabean Revolt.
* [
30:3
]
Healed
: for God as healer, see also
Ps 103:3
;
107:20
;
Hos 6:1
;
7:1
;
11:3
;
14:5
.
* [
30:4
]
Sheolâ€¦pit
: the shadowy underworld residence of the spirits of the dead, here a metaphor for near-death.
* [
30:7
]
Complacent
: untroubled existence is often seen as a source of temptation to forget God, cf.
Dt 8:10
–
18
;
Hos 13:6
;
Prv 30:9
.
* [
30:10
] In the stillness of Sheol no one gives you praise; let me live and be among your worshipers, cf.
Ps 6:6
;
88:11
