CHAPTER 5
Against Presumption
*
1
Do not rely on your wealth,
or say, “I have the power.”
a
2
Do not rely on your strength
in following the desires of your heart.
3
Do not say, “Who can prevail against me?”
for the L
ORD
will exact punishment.
4
Do not say, “I have sinned, yet what has happened to me?”
for the L
ORD
is slow to anger!
5
Do not be so confident of forgiveness
that you add sin upon sin.
6
Do not say, “His mercy is great;
my many sins he will forgive.”
For mercy and anger alike are with him;
his wrath comes to rest on the wicked.
7
Do not delay turning back to the L
ORD
,
do not put it off day after day.
For suddenly his wrath will come forth;
at the time of vengeance, you will perish.
8
Do not rely on deceitful wealth,
for it will be no help on the day of wrath.
b
Use and Abuse of the Tongue
*
9
Do not winnow in every wind,
nor walk in every path.
*
10
Be steadfast regarding your knowledge,
and let your speech be consistent.
11
Be swift to hear,
but slow to answer.
c
12
If you can, answer your neighbor;
if not, place your hand over your mouth!
13
Honor and dishonor through speaking!
The tongue can be your downfall.
14
Do not be called double-tongued;
and with your tongue do not slander a neighbor.
For shame has been created for the thief,
and sore disgrace for the double-tongued.
15
In little or in much, do not act corruptly;
* [
5:1
–
8
] The vices of the rich are pride and independence (vv.
1
–
2
), presumption (v.
3
), false security (vv.
4
–
6
), and impenitence (v.
7
), which cannot escape the divine wrath (vv.
7
–
8
). Cf.
Prv 18:23
;
19:1
;
28:6
.
* [
5:9
–
6:1
] Proper use of the tongue requires constancy in speech (v.
10
), prudence (vv.
11
–
12
), good judgment (v.
13
), charity (
5:15
;
6:1
); detraction, calumny (v.
14
), and double-talk bring shame and disgrace (
5:14
;
6:1
).
* [
5:9
] The metaphors indicate careless behavior.
