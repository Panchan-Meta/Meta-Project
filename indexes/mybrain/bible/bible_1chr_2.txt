z
* [
2:3
–
4:23
] The Chronicler had two reasons for placing his genealogy of the tribe of Judah before those of the other tribes, and for making it longer than all the others: his interest in David, who was of the tribe of Judah; and the prominence of descendants of that tribe among the Jews of the Chronicler’s time.
* [
2:9
]
Chelubai
: a variant form of the name Caleb (vv.
18
,
42
), a different person from the Chelub mentioned in
4:11
.
* [
2:10
–
17
] These verses list the immediate ancestors of David. A similar list appears in
Ru 4:18
–
22
.
* [
2:18
–
24
] These verses record the descendants of Caleb. In
4:15
as well as frequently in the Pentateuch (see
Nm 13:6
;
14:6
,
30
;
26:65
; etc.), Caleb is called the son of Jephunneh. Here his father is called Hezron, perhaps because the Calebites were reckoned as part of the clan of the Hezronites.
* [
2:25
–
41
] The Jerahmeelites were a clan living in the Negeb of Judah.
* [
2:42
–
49
] Another list (see vv.

–
24
) of the Calebites, a clan inhabiting the south of Judah.
* [
