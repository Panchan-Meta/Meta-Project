PSALM 148
*
All Creation Summoned to Praise
1
Hallelujah!
I
Praise the L
ORD
from the heavens;
praise him in the heights.
2
Praise him, all you his angels;
give praise, all you his hosts.
a
3
Praise him, sun and moon;
praise him, all shining stars.
4
Praise him, highest heavens,
*
you waters above the heavens.
5
Let them all praise the L
ORD
’s name;
for he commanded and they were created,
b
6
Assigned them their station forever,
set an order that will never change.
II
7
Praise the L
ORD
from the earth,
you sea monsters and all the deeps of the sea;
c
8
Lightning and hail, snow and thick clouds,
storm wind that fulfills his command;
9
Mountains and all hills,
fruit trees and all cedars;
d
10
Animals wild and tame,
creatures that crawl and birds that fly;
e
11
Kings of the earth and all peoples,
princes and all who govern on earth;
12
Young men and women too,
old and young alike.
13
Let them all praise the L
ORD
’s name,
for his name alone is exalted,
His majesty above earth and heaven.
f
14
*
He has lifted high the horn of his people;
to the praise of all his faithful,
the Israelites, the people near to him.
Hallelujah!
* [
Psalm 148
] A hymn inviting the beings of heaven (

) and of earth (

* [
148:4
]
Highest heavens
: lit., “the heavens of the heavens,” i.e., the space above the firmament, where the “upper waters” are stored, cf.
Gn 1:6
–
7

;
1 Kgs 8:27
;
Ps 104:3
