CHAPTER 2
1
For, not thinking rightly, they said among themselves:
*
“Brief and troubled is our lifetime;
a
there is no remedy for our dying,
nor is anyone known to have come back from Hades.
2
For by mere chance were we born,
and hereafter we shall be as though we had not been;
Because the breath in our nostrils is smoke,
and reason a spark from the beating of our hearts,
3
And when this is quenched, our body will be ashes
and our spirit will be poured abroad like empty air.
b
4
Even our name will be forgotten in time,
and no one will recall our deeds.
So our life will pass away like the traces of a cloud,
and will be dispersed like a mist
Pursued by the sun’s rays
and overpowered by its heat.
5
For our lifetime is the passing of a shadow;
and our dying cannot be deferred
because it is fixed with a seal; and no one returns.
c
6
Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are here,
and make use of creation with youthful zest.
d
7
Let us have our fill of costly wine and perfumes,
and let no springtime blossom pass us by;
8
let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither.
9
Let no meadow be free from our wantonness;
everywhere let us leave tokens of our merriment,
for this is our portion, and this our lot.
e
10
Let us oppress the righteous poor;
let us neither spare the widow
nor revere the aged for hair grown white with time.
f
11
But let our strength be our norm of righteousness;
for weakness proves itself useless.
12
*
Let us lie in wait for the righteous one, because he is annoying to us;
he opposes our actions,
Reproaches us for transgressions of the law
*
and charges us with violations of our training.
g
13
He professes to have knowledge of God
and styles himself a child of the L
ORD
.
h
14
To us he is the censure of our thoughts;
merely to see him is a hardship for us,
i
15
Because his life is not like that of others,
and different are his ways.
16
He judges us debased;
he holds aloof from our paths as from things impure.
He calls blest the destiny of the righteous
and boasts that God is his Father.
j
17
Let us see whether his words be true;
let us find out what will happen to him in the end.
k
18
For if the righteous one is the son of God, God will help him
and deliver him from the hand of his foes.
l
19
With violence and torture let us put him to the test
that we may have proof of his gentleness
and try his patience.
20
Let us condemn him to a shameful death;
for according to his own words, God will take care of him.”
m
21
These were their thoughts, but they erred;
for their wickedness blinded them,
n
22
*
And they did not know the hidden counsels of God;
neither did they count on a recompense for holiness
nor discern the innocent souls’ reward.
o
23
For God formed us to be imperishable;
the image of his own nature he made us.
p
24
But by the envy
*
of the devil, death entered the world,
and they who are allied with him experience it.
q
* [
2:1
–
20
] In this speech the wicked deny survival after death and indeed invite death by their evil deeds.
* [
2:12
–
5:23
] From
2:12
to
5:23
the author draws heavily on
Is 52
–
62
, setting forth his teaching in a series of characters or types taken from Isaiah and embellished with additional details from other texts. The description of the “righteous one” in
2:12
–
20
seems to undergird the New Testament passion narrative.
* [
2:12
]
Law
: the law of Moses; “training” has the same meaning.
* [
2:22
] This verse announces the subject of the next section.
* [
2:24
]
Envy
: perhaps because Adam was in the image of God or because Adam had control over all creation.
Devil
: the first biblical text to equate the serpent of
Gn 3
with the devil.
