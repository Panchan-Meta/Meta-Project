CHAPTER 8
1
Would that you were a brother to me,
nursed at my mother’s breasts!
If I met you out of doors, I would kiss you
and none would despise me.
2
a
I would lead you, bring you to my mother’s house,
where you would teach me,
Where I would give you to drink
spiced wine, my pomegranate
*
juice.
3
b
His left hand is under my head,
and his right arm embraces me.
4
c
I adjure you, Daughters of Jerusalem,
do not awaken or stir up love
until it is ready!
The Return from the Desert
5
D?
d
Who is this coming up from the desert,
leaning upon her lover?
W
Beneath the apple tree I awakened you;
*
there your mother conceived you;
there she who bore you conceived.
True Love
6
Set me as a seal
*
upon your heart,
as a seal upon your arm;
For Love is strong as Death,
longing is fierce as Sheol.
Its arrows are arrows of fire,
flames of the divine.
7
e
Deep waters
*
cannot quench love,
nor rivers sweep it away.
Were one to offer all the wealth of his house for love,
he would be utterly despised.
An Answer to the Brothers
8
W
“We have a little sister;
*
she has no breasts as yet.
What shall we do for our sister
on the day she is spoken for?
9
If she is a wall,
we will build upon her a silver turret;
But if she is a door,
we will board her up with cedar planks.”
10
I am a wall,
*
and my breasts are like towers.
I became in his eyes
as one who brings peace.
A Boast
11
M?
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
*
he gave over the vineyard to caretakers.
For its fruit one would have to pay
a thousand silver pieces.
12
My vineyard is at my own disposal;
the thousand pieces are for you, Solomon,
and two hundred for the caretakers of its fruit.
The Lovers’ Yearnings
13
M
You who dwell in the gardens,
*
my companions are listening for your voice—
let me hear it!
14
W
f
Swiftly, my lover,
be like a gazelle or a young stag
upon the mountains of spices.
* [
8:2
]
Wine…pomegranate
: sexual connotations are implied, since the root “drink” (
shaqah
) is a wordplay on “kiss” (
nashaq
) in v.
1
; cf.
1:2
.
* [
8:5
]
Awakened you
: the speakers in this verse are difficult to identify. Someone (the poet? Daughters?) hails the couple in v.
5a
. According to the Masoretic vocalization, the woman is the speaker in v.
5b
.
* [
8:6
]
Seal
: this could be worn bound to the arm, as here, or suspended at the neck, or as a ring (
Jer 22:24
). It was used for identification and signatures.
Strong…fierce
: in human experience, Death and Sheol are inevitable, unrelenting; in the end they always triumph. Love, which is just as certain of its victory, matches its strength against the natural enemies of life; waters cannot extinguish it nor floods carry it away. It is more priceless than all riches.
Flames of the divine
: the Hebrew is difficult: the short form (-Yah) of the divine name Yhwh found here may associate love with the Lord, or it may be acting as a superlative—i.e., god-sized flames.
* [
8:7
]
Deep waters
: often used to designate chaos (
Ps 93:4
;
144:7
;
Is 17:12
–
13
;
Hb 3:15
). The fires of love cannot be extinguished, even by waters of chaos.
Wealth
: love cannot be bought.
* [
8:8
–
9
] The woman quotes the course of action her elder brothers had decided on. While she is yet immature, they will shelter her in view of eventual marriage.
Wall…door
: if she is virtuous, she will be honored; if she is not, she will be kept under strict vigilance.
Silver turret
: a precious ornament.
* [
8:10
] In reply to the officious and meddling attitude of the brothers, she answers with their terms: she is mature (“wall,” “towers”).
Brings peace
: or, “finds peace.”
* [
8:11
–
12
] These enigmatic verses have been variously interpreted, depending on who is taken to be the speaker. In v.
11
, if the woman, she boasts that she is a vineyard of great value. If the man, he boasts over his possession of her.
* [
8:13
–
14
] As in
2:14
, her lover asks for a word or a song and she replies in words similar to those found in
2:17
.
