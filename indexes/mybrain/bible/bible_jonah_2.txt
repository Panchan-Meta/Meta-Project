CHAPTER 2
Jonah’s Prayer.
1
But the L
ORD
sent a great fish to swallow Jonah, and he remained in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
a
2
Jonah prayed to the L
ORD
, his God, from the belly of the fish:
3
*
Out of my distress I called to the L
ORD
,
and he answered me;
From the womb of Sheol
*
I cried for help,
and you heard my voice.
b
4
You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the sea,
and the flood enveloped me;
All your breakers and your billows
passed over me.
c
5
Then I said, “I am banished from your sight!
How will I again look upon your holy temple?”
d
6
The waters surged around me up to my neck;
the deep enveloped me;
seaweed wrapped around my head.
e
7
I went down to the roots of the mountains;
to the land whose bars closed behind me forever,
But you brought my life up from the pit,
O L
ORD
, my God.
f
8
When I became faint,
I remembered the L
ORD
;
My prayer came to you
in your holy temple.
g
9
Those who worship worthless idols
abandon their hope for mercy.
h
10
But I, with thankful voice,
will sacrifice to you;
What I have vowed I will pay:
deliverance is from the L
ORD
.
i
11
Then the L
ORD
commanded the fish to vomit Jonah upon dry land.
* [
2:3
–
10
] These verses, which may have originally been an independent composition, are a typical example of a song of thanksgiving, a common psalm genre (e.g.,
Ps 116
;
Is 38:9
–
20
). Such a song is relevant here, since Jonah has not drowned, and the imagery of vv.
4
,
6
is appropriate.
