Titus
Introduction

CHAPTER 3
1
*
Remind them to be under the control of magistrates and authorities,
*
to be obedient, to be open to every good enterprise.
a
2
They are to slander no one, to be peaceable, considerate, exercising all graciousness toward everyone.
3
For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, deluded, slaves to various desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful ourselves and hating one another.
b
4
But when the kindness and generous love
of God our savior appeared,
c
5
not because of any righteous deeds we had done
but because of his mercy,
he saved us through the bath of rebirth
and renewal by the holy Spirit,
d
6
whom he richly poured out on us
through Jesus Christ our savior,
e
7
so that we might be justified by his grace
and become heirs in hope of eternal life.
f
8
This saying is trustworthy.
Advice to Titus.
*
I want you to insist on these points, that those who have believed in God be careful to devote themselves to good works; these are excellent and beneficial to others.
g
9
*
Avoid foolish arguments, genealogies, rivalries, and quarrels about the law,
h
for they are useless and futile.
10
After a first and second warning, break off contact with a heretic,
i
11
realizing that such a person is perverted and sinful and stands self-condemned.
Directives, Greetings, and Blessing.
*
12
When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, try to join me at Nicopolis, where I have decided to spend the winter.
j
13
Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey soon, and see to it that they have everything they need.
k
14
But let our people, too, learn to devote themselves to good works to supply urgent needs, so that they may not be unproductive.
l
15
All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith.
Grace be with all of you.

* [

] The list of Christian duties continues from
Ti 2:9
–
10
, undergirded again as in
Ti 2:11
–
13
by appeal to what God in Christ has done (
Ti 2:4
–
7
; cf.
Ti 2:11
–
14
). The spiritual renewal of the Cretans, signified in God’s merciful gift of baptism (
Ti 3:4
–
7
), should be reflected in their improved attitude toward civil authority and in their Christian relationship with all (
Ti 3:1
–
3
).
* [
3:1
]
Magistrates and authorities
: some interpreters understand these terms as referring to the principalities and powers of the heavenly hierarchy.
To be open to every good enterprise
: this implies being good citizens. It could also be translated “ready to do every sort of good work” (as Christians); cf.
Ti 3:14
.
* [
3:8
–
11
] In matters of good conduct and religious doctrine, Titus is to stand firm.
