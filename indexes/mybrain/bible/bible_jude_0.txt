THE LETTER OF JUDE
This letter is by its address attributed to “Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ and brother of James” (
Jude 1
). Since he is not identified as an apostle, this designation can hardly be meant to refer to the Jude or Judas who is listed as one of the Twelve (
Lk 6:16
;
Acts 1:13
; cf.
Jn 14:22
). The person intended is almost certainly the other Jude, named in the gospels among the relatives of Jesus (
Mt 13:55
;
Mk 6:3
), and the James who is listed there as his brother is the one to whom the Letter of James is attributed (see the Introduction to James). Nothing else is known of this Jude, and the apparent need to identify him by reference to his better-known brother indicates that he was a rather obscure personage in the early church.
The letter is addressed in the most general terms to “those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept safe for Jesus Christ” (
Jude 1
), hence apparently to all Christians. But since its purpose is to warn the addressees against false teachers, the author must have had in mind one or more specific Christian communities located in the unidentified region where the errors in question constituted a danger. While the letter contains some Semitic features, there is nothing to identify the addressees specifically as Jewish Christians; indeed, the errors envisaged seem to reflect an early form of gnosticism, opposed to law, that points rather to the cultural context of the Gentile world. Like James and 2 Peter, the Letter of Jude manifests none of the typical features of the letter form except the address.
There is so much similarity between Jude and 2 Peter, especially
Jude 4
–
16
and
2 Pt 2:1
–
18
, that there must be a literary relationship between them. Since there is no evidence for the view that both authors borrowed from the same source, it is usually supposed that one of them borrowed from the other. Most scholars believe that Jude is the earlier of the two, principally because he quotes two apocryphal Jewish works, the Assumption of Moses (
Jude 9
) and the Book of Enoch (
Jude 14
–
15
) as part of his structured argument, whereas 2 Peter omits both references. Since there was controversy in the early church about the propriety of citing noncanonical literature that included legendary material, it is more probable that a later writer would omit such references than that he would add them.
Many interpreters today consider Jude a pseudonymous work dating from the end of the first century or even later. In support of this view they adduce the following arguments: (a) the apostles are referred to as belonging to an age that has receded into the past (
Jude 17
–
18
); (b) faith is understood as a body of doctrine handed down by a process of tradition (
Jude 3
); (c) the author’s competent Greek style shows that he must have had a Hellenistic cultural formation; (d) the gnostic character of the errors envisaged fits better into the early second century than into a period several decades earlier. While impressive, these arguments are not entirely compelling and do not completely rule out the possibility of composition around the year A.D. 80, when the historical Jude may still have been alive.
This little letter is an urgent note by an author who intended to write more fully about salvation to an unknown group of readers, but who was forced by dangers from false teachers worming their way into the community (
Jude 3
–
4
) to dash off a warning against them (
Jude 5
–
16
) and to deliver some pressing Christian admonitions (
Jude 17
–
23
). The letter is justly famous for its majestic closing doxology (
24
–
25
).
