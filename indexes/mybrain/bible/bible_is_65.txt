CHAPTER 65
1
*
I was ready to respond to those who did not ask,
to be found by those who did not seek me.
I said: Here I am! Here I am!
To a nation that did not invoke my name.
a
2
I have stretched out my hands all day
to a rebellious people,
Who walk in a way that is not good,
following their own designs;
b
3
A people who provoke me
continually to my face,
Offering sacrifices in gardens
and burning incense on bricks,
4
Sitting in tombs
and spending the night in caves,
Eating the flesh of pigs,
with broth of unclean meat in their dishes;
5
Crying out, “Hold back,
do not come near me, lest I render you holy!”
*
These things are smoke in my nostrils,
a fire that burns all the day.
6
See, it stands written before me;
I will not remain quiet until I have repaid in full
7
Your crimes and the crimes of your ancestors as well,
says the L
ORD
.
Since they burned incense on the mountains,
and insulted me on the hills,
I will at once pour out in full measure
their recompense into their laps.
Fate of the Just and Unjust in Israel
8
*
Thus says the L
ORD
:
As when the juice is pressed from a cluster,
and someone says, “Do not destroy it,
for there is still good in it,”
So will I do for the sake of my servants:
I will not destroy them all.
9
From Jacob I will bring forth offspring,
from Judah, those who are to possess my mountains;
My chosen ones shall possess the land,
my servants shall dwell there.
10
Sharon shall become a pasture for the flocks,
the Valley of Achor a resting place for the cattle,
for my people who have sought me.
c
11
But you who forsake the L
ORD
,
who forget my holy mountain,
Who spread a table for Fortune
and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny,
*
12
You I will destine for the sword;
you shall all bow down for slaughter;
Because I called and you did not answer,
I spoke and you did not listen,
But did what is evil in my sight
and things I do not delight in, you chose,
d
13
therefore thus says the Lord G
OD
:
My servants shall eat,
but you shall go hungry;
My servants shall drink,
but you shall be thirsty;
My servants shall rejoice,
but you shall be put to shame;
14
My servants shall shout
for joy of heart,
But you shall cry out for grief of heart,
and howl for anguish of spirit.
15
You will leave your name for a curse to my chosen ones
when the Lord G
OD
slays you,
and calls his servants by another name.
16
Whoever invokes a blessing in the land
shall bless by the God of truth;
*
Whoever takes an oath in the land
shall swear by the God of truth;
For the hardships of the past shall be forgotten
and hidden from my eyes.
A World Renewed
17
*
See, I am creating new heavens
and a new earth;
The former things shall not be remembered
nor come to mind.
e
18
Instead, shout for joy and be glad forever
in what I am creating.
Indeed, I am creating Jerusalem to be a joy
and its people to be a delight;
19
I will rejoice in Jerusalem
and exult in my people.
No longer shall the sound of weeping be heard there,
or the sound of crying;
20
No longer shall there be in it
an infant who lives but a few days,
nor anyone who does not live a full lifetime;
One who dies at a hundred years shall be considered a youth,
and one who falls short of a hundred shall be thought accursed.
f
21
They shall build houses and live in them,
they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit;
22
They shall not build and others live there;
they shall not plant and others eat.
As the years of a tree, so the years of my people;
and my chosen ones shall long enjoy
the work of their hands.
23
They shall not toil in vain,
nor beget children for sudden destruction;
For they shall be a people blessed by the L
ORD
and their descendants with them.
24
Before they call, I will answer;
while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
25
*
The wolf and the lamb shall pasture together,
and the lion shall eat hay like the ox—
but the serpent’s food shall be dust.
g
None shall harm or destroy
on all my holy mountain, says the L
ORD
.
* [
65:1
–
7
] These verses serve as a response to the preceding questions about God’s inaction (
64:6
,
11
). It is not God who has been absent, but the people who have walked away from God by idolatrous acts and rituals (vv.
3
–
4
). That is the reason for their punishment (vv.
6
–
7
).
* [
65:5
]
Render you holy
: unclean food is what these people claim has made them sacred! The prophet ridicules them. Sacredness was understood as something communicable (cf.
Ex 19:9
–
15
).
* [
65:8
] This verse reflects the remnant theology found elsewhere in the Book of Isaiah:
1:8
–
9
;
4:3
;
6:11
–
13
; etc.
* [
65:11
–
12
]
Destiny
: the play on words is found in the Hebrew, in which “destiny” and “destine” are
menî
and
manîthî
.
* [
65:16
]
God of truth
: lit., “God of Amen,” i.e., the one who keeps his word.
* [
65:17
–
18
] The new creation (cf.
66:22
) is described with apocalyptic exuberance: long life, material prosperity, and so forth. As the former events in
43:18
are to be forgotten, so also the new creation wipes out memory of the first creation.
* [
65:25
] The imagery reflects the ideal era described in
11:6
–
