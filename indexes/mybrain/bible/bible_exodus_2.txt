CHAPTER 2
Birth and Adoption of Moses.
1
Now a man
*
of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,
a
2
and the woman conceived and bore a son. Seeing what a fine child he was, she hid him for three months.
b
3
But when she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket,
*
daubed it with bitumen and pitch, and putting the child in it, placed it among the reeds on the bank of the Nile.
4
His sister stationed herself at a distance to find out what would happen to him.
5
Then Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the Nile, while her attendants walked along the bank of the Nile. Noticing the basket among the reeds, she sent her handmaid to fetch it.
6
On opening it, she looked, and there was a baby boy crying! She was moved with pity for him and said, “It is one of the Hebrews’ children.”
7
Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and summon a Hebrew woman to nurse the child for you?”
8
Pharaoh’s daughter answered her, “Go.” So the young woman went and called the child’s own mother.
9
Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages.”
*
So the woman took the child and nursed him.
10
When the child grew,
*
she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son.
c
She named him Moses; for she said, “I drew him out of the water.”
Moses’ Flight to Midian.
11
d
On one occasion, after Moses had grown up,
*
when he had gone out to his kinsmen and witnessed their forced labor, he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his own kinsmen.
12
Looking about and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
13
The next day he went out again, and now two Hebrews were fighting! So he asked the culprit, “Why are you striking your companion?”
14
But he replied, “Who has appointed you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses became afraid and thought, “The affair must certainly be known.”
15
When Pharaoh heard of the affair, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to the land of Midian.
*
e
There he sat down by a well.
16
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock.
17
But shepherds came and drove them away. So Moses rose up in their defense and watered their flock.
18
When they returned to their father Reuel,
*
he said to them, “How is it you have returned so soon today?”
19
They answered, “An Egyptian
*
delivered us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock!”
20
“Where is he?” he asked his daughters. “Why did you leave the man there? Invite him to have something to eat.”
21
Moses agreed to stay with him, and the man gave Moses his daughter Zipporah in marriage.
22
She conceived and bore a son, whom he named Gershom;
*
for he said, “I am a stranger residing in a foreign land.”

II. THE CALL AND COMMISSION OF MOSES
The Burning Bush.
23
A long time passed, during which the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under their bondage and cried out, and from their bondage their cry for help went up to God.
g
24
God heard their moaning and God was mindful of his covenant
h
with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
25
God saw the Israelites, and God knew….
*
* [
2:1
]
Now a man
: the chapter begins abruptly, without names for the man or woman (in contrast to the midwives of
1:15
), who in
6:20
are identified as Amram and Jochebed.
* [
2:3
]
Basket
: the same Hebrew word is used in
Gn 6:14
and throughout the flood narrative for Noah’s ark, but nowhere else in the Bible. Here, however, the “ark” or “chest” was made of papyrus stalks. Presumably the allusion to Genesis is intentional. Just as Noah and his family were preserved safe from the threatening waters of the flood in the ark he built, so now Moses is preserved from the threatening waters of the Nile in the ark prepared by his mother.
Among the reeds
: the Hebrew noun for “reed” is overwhelmingly used in the phrase “Reed Sea,” traditionally translated “Red Sea.”
* [
2:9
]
And I will pay your wages
: the idea that the child’s mother will be paid for nursing her child—and by Pharaoh’s own daughter—heightens the narrative’s irony.
* [
2:10
]
When the child grew
: while v.
9
implies that the boy’s mother cared for him as long as he needed to be nursed (presumably, between two and four years), the same verb appears in v.
11
to describe the attainment of adulthood.
And he became her son
: Pharaoh’s daughter adopts Moses, thus adding to the irony of the account. The king of Egypt had ordered the killing of all the sons of the Hebrews, and one now becomes the son of his own daughter!
Moses
: in Hebrew,
mosheh
. There is a play on words here: Hebrew
mosheh
echoes
meshithihu
(“I drew him out”). However, the name Moses actually has nothing to do with that Hebrew verb, but is probably derived from Egyptian “beloved” or “has been born,” preserved in such Pharaonic names as Thutmoses (meaning approximately “Beloved of the god Thoth” or “The god Thoth is born, has given birth to [the child]”). The original meaning of Moses’ name was no longer remembered (if it was Egyptian, it may have contained an Egyptian divine element as well, perhaps the name of the Nile god Hapi), and a secondary explanation was derived from this story (or gave rise to it, if the drawing from the water of the Nile was intended to foreshadow the Israelites’ escape from Egypt through the Red Sea).
* [
2:11
]
After Moses had grown up
: cf.
7:7
, where Moses is said to be eighty years old at the time of his mission to Pharaoh.
Striking
: probably in the sense of “flogging”; in v.
12
, however, the same verb is used in the sense of “killing.”
* [
2:15
]
Land of Midian
: the territory under the control of a confederation made up, according to
Nm 31:8
, of five Midianite tribes. According to
Gn 25:1
–
2
, Midian was a son of Abraham by Keturah. In view of the extreme hostility in later periods between Israel and Midian (cf.
Nm 31
;
Jgs 6
–
8
), the relationship is striking, as is the account here in Exodus of good relations between Moses and no less than a Midianite priest.
* [
2:18
]
Reuel
: also called Jethro. Cf.
3:1
;
4:18
;
18:1
.
* [
2:19
]
An Egyptian
: Moses was probably wearing Egyptian dress, or spoke Egyptian to Reuel’s daughters.
* [
2:22
]
Gershom
: the name is explained unscientifically as if it came from the Hebrew word
ger
, “sojourner, resident alien,” and the Hebrew word
sham
, “there.”
Stranger residing
: Hebrew
ger
, one who seeks and finds shelter and a home away from his or her own people or land.
* [
2:25
]
God knew
: in response to the people’s cry, God, mindful of the covenant, looks on their plight and acknowledges firsthand the depth of their suffering (see
3:7
). In vv.
23
–
25
, traditionally attributed to the Priestly writer, God is mentioned five times, in contrast to the rest of chaps.
1
–
2
, where God is rarely mentioned. These verses serve as a fitting transition to Moses’ call in chap.
