PSALM 18
*
A King’s Thanksgiving for Victory
1
For the leader. Of David, the servant of the L
ORD
, who sang to the L
ORD
the words of this song after the L
ORD
had rescued him from the clutches of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
2
He said:
a
I
I love you, L
ORD
, my strength,
3
L
ORD
, my rock, my fortress, my deliverer,
My God, my rock of refuge,
my shield, my saving horn,
*
my stronghold!
b
4
Praised be the L
ORD
, I exclaim!
I have been delivered from my enemies.
II
5
The cords of death encompassed me;
the torrents of destruction terrified me.
6
The cords
*
of Sheol encircled me;
the snares of death lay in wait for me.
c
7
In my distress I called out: L
ORD
!
I cried out to my God.
d
From his temple he heard my voice;
my cry to him reached his ears.
8
*
The earth rocked and shook;
the foundations of the mountains trembled;
they shook as his wrath flared up.
e
9
Smoke rose from his nostrils,
a devouring fire from his mouth;
it kindled coals into flame.
10
He parted the heavens and came down,
a dark cloud under his feet.
f
11
Mounted on a cherub
*
he flew,
borne along on the wings of the wind.
12
He made darkness his cloak around him;
his canopy, water-darkened stormclouds.
13
From the gleam before him, his clouds passed,
hail and coals of fire.
g
14
The L
ORD
thundered from heaven;
the Most High made his voice resound.
h
15
He let fly his arrows
*
and scattered them;
shot his lightning bolts and dispersed them.
i
16
Then the bed of the sea appeared;
the world’s foundations lay bare,
j
At your rebuke, O L
ORD
,
at the storming breath of your nostrils.
17
He reached down from on high and seized me;
drew me out of the deep waters.
k
18
He rescued me from my mighty enemy,
from foes too powerful for me.
19
They attacked me on my day of distress,
but the L
ORD
was my support.
20
He set me free in the open;
he rescued me because he loves me.
III
21
The L
ORD
acknowledged my righteousness,
rewarded my clean hands.
l
22
For I kept the ways of the L
ORD
;
I was not disloyal to my God.
23
For his laws were all before me,
his decrees I did not cast aside.
24
I was honest toward him;
I was on guard against sin.
25
So the L
ORD
rewarded my righteousness,
the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
26
Toward the faithful you are faithful;
to the honest man you are honest;
m
27
Toward the pure, you are pure;
but to the perverse you are devious.
28
For humble people you save;
haughty eyes you bring low.
n
29
For you, L
ORD
, give light to my lamp;
my God brightens my darkness.
o
30
With you I can rush an armed band,
with my God to help I can leap a wall.
31
God’s way is unerring;
the L
ORD
’s promise is refined;
he is a shield for all who take refuge in him.
p
IV
32
Truly, who is God except the L
ORD
?
Who but our God is the rock?
q
33
This God who girded me with might,
kept my way unerring,
34
Who made my feet like a deer’s,
and set me on the heights,
r
35
Who trained my hands for war,
my arms to string a bow of bronze.
*
s
V
36
You have given me your saving shield;
your right hand has upheld me;
your favor made me great.
37
You made room for my steps beneath me;
my ankles never twisted.
t
38
I pursued my enemies and overtook them;
I did not turn back till I destroyed them.
39
I decimated them; they could not rise;
they fell at my feet.
40
You girded me with valor for war,
subjugated my opponents beneath me.
41
You made my foes expose their necks to me;
those who hated me I silenced.
42
They cried for help, but no one saved them;
cried to the L
ORD
but received no answer.
43
I ground them to dust before the wind;
I left them like mud in the streets.
44
You rescued me from the strife of peoples;
you made me head over nations.
A people I had not known served me;
45
as soon as they heard of me they obeyed.
Foreigners submitted before me;
46
foreigners cringed;
they came cowering from their dungeons.
u
VI
47
The L
ORD
lives! Blessed be my rock!
v
Exalted be God, my savior!
48
O God who granted me vengeance,
made peoples subject to me,
w
49
and saved me from my enemies,
Truly you have elevated me above my opponents,
from a man of lawlessness you have rescued me.
50
Thus I will praise you, L
ORD
, among the nations;
I will sing praises to your name.
x
51
You have given great victories to your king,
and shown mercy to his anointed,
to David and his posterity forever.

* [
Psalm 18
] A royal thanksgiving for a military victory, duplicated in
2 Sm 22
. Thanksgiving Psalms are in essence reports of divine rescue. The Psalm has two parallel reports of rescue, the first told from a heavenly perspective (
Ps 18:5
–
20
), and the second from an earthly perspective (
Ps 18:36
–
46
). The first report adapts old mythic language of a cosmic battle between sea and rainstorm in order to depict God’s rescue of the Israelite king from his enemies. Each report has a short hymnic introduction (
Ps 18:2
–
4
,
32
–
36
) and conclusion (
Ps 18:21
–
31
,
47
–
50
).
* [
18:3
]
My saving horn
: my strong savior. The horn referred to is the weapon of a bull and the symbol of fertility, cf.
1 Sm 2:10
;
Ps 132:17
;
Lk 1:69
.
* [
18:6
]
Cords
: hunting imagery, the cords of a snare.
* [
18:8
–
16
] God appears in the storm, which in Palestine comes from the west. The introduction to the theophany (
Ps 18:8
–
9
) is probably a description of a violent, hot, and dry east-wind storm. In the fall transition period from the rainless summer to the rainy winter such storms regularly precede the rains, cf.
Ex 14:21
–
22
.
* [
18:11
]
Cherub
: a winged creature, derived from myth, in the service of the deity (
Gn 3:24
;
Ex 25:18
–
20
;
37:6
–
9
). Cherubim were the throne bearers of the deity (
Ps 80:2
;
99:1
;
1 Kgs 6:23
–
28
;
8:6
–
8
).
* [
18:15
]
Arrows
: lightning.
* [
18:35
]
Bow of bronze
: hyperbole for a bow difficult to bend and therefore capable of propelling an arrow with great force.
