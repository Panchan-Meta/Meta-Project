CHAPTER 7
1
So the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim came for the ark of the L
ORD
and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, appointing his son Eleazar as guardian of the ark of the L
ORD
.
Samuel the Judge.
2
From the day the ark came to rest in Kiriath-jearim, a long time, twenty years, elapsed, and the whole house of Israel turned to the L
ORD
.
3
Then Samuel addressed the whole house of Israel: “If you would return to the L
ORD
with your whole heart, remove your foreign gods and your Astartes, fix your hearts on the L
ORD
, and serve him alone, then the L
ORD
will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”
a
4
So the Israelites removed their Baals and Astartes,
*
and served the L
ORD
alone.
5
Samuel then gave orders, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, that I may pray to the L
ORD
for you.”
b
6
When they had gathered at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out
*
on the ground before the L
ORD
, and they fasted that day, saying, “We have sinned against the L
ORD
.” It was at Mizpah that Samuel began to judge the Israelites.
c
Rout of the Philistines.
7
When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, their leaders went up against Israel. Hearing this, the Israelites became afraid of the Philistines
8
and appealed to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the L
ORD
our God for us, to save us from the hand of the Philistines.”
d
9
Samuel therefore took an unweaned lamb and offered it whole as a burnt offering to the L
ORD
.
e
He cried out to the L
ORD
for Israel, and the L
ORD
answered him.
10
While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near for battle with Israel. That day, however, the L
ORD
thundered loudly against the Philistines, and threw them into such confusion that they were defeated by Israel.
f
11
Thereupon the Israelites rushed out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, striking them down even beyond Beth-car.
12
Samuel then took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Jeshanah; he named it Ebenezer,
*
explaining, “As far as this place the L
ORD
has been our help.”
13
Thus were the Philistines subdued, never again to enter the territory of Israel, for the hand of the L
ORD
was against them as long as Samuel lived.
g
14
The cities from Ekron to Gath which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to them. Israel also freed the territory of these cities from Philistine domination. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.
*
15
Samuel judged Israel as long as he lived.
16
He made a yearly circuit, passing through Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpah
*
and judging Israel at each of these places.
17
Then he used to return to Ramah, for that was his home. There, too, he judged Israel and built an altar to the L
ORD
.

Baals and Astartes
: a Deuteronomistic phrase; cf.
Jgs 2:13
;
10:6
;
1 Sm 12:10
. Baal and Astarte were Canaanite divinities.
* [
7:6
]
Drew water and poured it out
: this ritual act does not appear elsewhere in the Old Testament. Linked with fasting and admission of sin, it seems to function as a purification ritual that washes away the guilt incurred by worshiping the Canaanite Baal and his consort Astarte. Its effectiveness is immediately evident when the Lord thunders a response to Samuel’s offering.
* [
7:12
]
Ebenezer
: “stone of the helper,” i.e., the Lord.
* [
7:14
]
The Amorites
: enemies in Transjordan. Israel is now secure, safe from external and internal threat.
* [
7:16
]
Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpah
: Bethel and Mizpah are located about five and eight miles north of Jerusalem respectively, in the district around Ramah, Samuel’s home. Perhaps Gilgal, which has not been definitively located, was also in this area.
