PSALM 124
*
God, the Rescuer of the People
1
A song of ascents. Of David.
Had not the L
ORD
been with us,
let Israel say,
a
2
Had not the L
ORD
been with us,
when people rose against us,
3
Then they would have swallowed us alive,
b
for their fury blazed against us.
4
Then the waters would have engulfed us,
the torrent overwhelmed us;
c
5
then seething water would have drowned us.
6
Blessed is the L
ORD
, who did not leave us
to be torn by their teeth.
7
We escaped with our lives like a bird
from the fowler’s snare;
the snare was broken,
and we escaped.
8
*
Our help is in the name of the L
ORD
,
the maker of heaven and earth.
d
* [
Psalm 124
] A thanksgiving which teaches that Israel’s very existence is owed to God who rescues them. In the first part Israel’s enemies are compared to the mythic sea dragon (
Ps 124:2b
–
3a
; cf.
Jer 51:34
) and Flood (
Ps 124:3b
–
5
; cf.
Is 51:9
–
10
). The Psalm heightens the malice of human enemies by linking them to the primordial enemies of God’s creation. Israel is a bird freed from the trapper’s snare (
Ps 124:6
–
8
)—freed originally from Pharaoh and now from the current danger.
