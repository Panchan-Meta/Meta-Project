CHAPTER 12
1
You would be in the right, O L
ORD
,
if I should dispute with you;
even so, I must lay out the case against you.
Why does the way of the wicked prosper,
why do all the treacherous live in contentment?
a
2
You planted them; they have taken root,
they flourish and bear fruit as well.
You are upon their lips,
but far from their thoughts.
b
3
L
ORD
, you know me, you see me,
you have found that my heart is with you.
c
Pick them out like sheep for the butcher,
set them apart for the day of slaughter.
*
4
How long must the land mourn,
the grass of the whole countryside wither?
Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it
beasts and birds disappear,
for they say, “God does not care about our future.”
5
If running against men has wearied you,
how will you race against horses?
And if you are safe only on a level stretch,
what will you do in the jungle of the Jordan?
6
Your kindred and your father’s house, even they betray you; they have recruited a force against you. Do not believe them, even when they speak fair words to you.

The Lord’s Complaint
7
I have abandoned my house,
cast off my heritage;
The beloved of my soul I have delivered
into the hand of her foes.
e
8
My heritage has become for me
like a lion in the thicket;
She has raised her voice against me,
therefore she has incurred my hatred.
f
9
My heritage is a prey for hyenas,
is surrounded by vultures;
Come, gather together, all you wild animals,
come and eat!
g
10
Many shepherds have ravaged my vineyard,
have trampled down my heritage;
My delightful portion they have turned
into a desert waste.
h
11
They have made it a mournful waste,
desolate before me,
Desolate, the whole land,
because no one takes it to heart.
12
Upon every height in the wilderness
marauders have appeared.
The L
ORD
has a sword that consumes
the land from end to end:
no peace for any living thing.
i
13
They have sown wheat and reaped thorns,
they have tired themselves out for no purpose;
They are shamed by their harvest,
the burning anger of the L
ORD
.
Judah’s Neighbors.
14
Thus says the L
ORD
, against all my evil neighbors
*
who plunder the heritage I gave my people Israel as their own: See, I will uproot them from their land; the house of Judah I will uproot in their midst.
j
15
But after uprooting them, I will have compassion on them again and bring them back, each to their heritage, each to their land.
k
16
And if they truly learn my people’s custom of swearing by my name, “As the L
ORD
lives,” just as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built up in the midst of my people.
l
17
But if they do not obey, I will uproot and destroy that nation entirely—oracle of the L
ORD
.

* [
12:3
] Jeremiah calls the Lord to account for allowing the wicked to flourish while he himself is persecuted for his fidelity to the Lord’s mission; cf.
20:12
. See Jesus’ judgment,
Mk 9:42
. The metaphors indicate that Jeremiah has even greater trials ahead of him.
