CHAPTER 33
Overthrow of Assyria
*
1
Ah! You destroyer never destroyed,
betrayer never betrayed!
When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed;
when you have stopped betraying, you will be betrayed.
a
2
L
ORD
, be gracious to us; for you we wait.
Be our strength every morning,
our salvation in time of trouble!
b
3
At the roaring sound, peoples flee;
when you rise in your majesty, nations are scattered.
c
4
Spoil is gathered up as caterpillars gather,
an onrush like the rush of locusts.
d
5
The L
ORD
is exalted, enthroned on high;
he fills Zion with right and justice.
e
6
That which makes her seasons certain,
her wealth, salvation, wisdom, and knowledge,
is the fear of the L
ORD
, her treasure.
f
7
See, the men of Ariel cry out in the streets,
the messengers of Shalem
*
weep bitterly.
8
The highways are desolate,
travelers have quit the paths,
Covenants are broken, witnesses spurned;
yet no one gives it a thought.
g
9
The country languishes in mourning,
Lebanon withers with shame;
Sharon
*
is like the Arabah,
Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.
h
10
Now I will rise up, says the L
ORD
,
now exalt myself,
now lift myself up.
i
11
You conceive dry grass, bring forth stubble;
my spirit shall consume you like fire.
12
The peoples shall be burned to lime,
thorns cut down to burn in fire.
j
13
Hear, you who are far off, what I have done;
you who are near, acknowledge my might.
14
In Zion sinners are in dread,
trembling grips the impious:
“Who of us can live with consuming fire?
who of us can live with everlasting flames?”
k
15
Whoever walks righteously and speaks honestly,
who spurns what is gained by oppression,
Who waves off contact with a bribe,
who stops his ears so as not to hear of bloodshed,
who closes his eyes so as not to look on evil—
l
16
That one shall dwell on the heights,
with fortresses of rock for stronghold,
food and drink in steady supply.
17
Your eyes will see a king
*
in his splendor,
they will look upon a vast land.
m
18
Your mind will dwell on the terror:
“Where is the one who counted, where the one who weighed?
Where the one who counted the towers?”
n
19
You shall no longer see a defiant people,
a people of speech too obscure to comprehend,
stammering in a tongue not understood.
o
20
Look to Zion, the city of our festivals;
your eyes shall see Jerusalem
as a quiet abode, a tent not to be struck,
Whose pegs will never be pulled up,
nor any of its ropes severed.
p
21
Indeed the L
ORD
in majesty will be there for us
a place of rivers and wide streams
on which no galley may go,
where no majestic ship
*
may pass.
q
22
For the L
ORD
is our judge,
the L
ORD
is our lawgiver,
the L
ORD
is our king;
he it is who will save us.
23
The rigging hangs slack;
it cannot hold the mast in place,
nor keep the sail spread out.
Then the blind will divide great spoils
and the lame will carry off the loot.
r
24
No one who dwells there will say, “I am sick”;
the people who live there will be forgiven their guilt.
s
* [
33:1
–
24
] After an introductory address to Assyria (v.
1
), there follows a prayer on behalf of Jerusalem which recalls what God had done in the past (vv.
2
–
6
) and a description of the present situation (vv.
7
–
9
). In response, the Lord announces a judgment on Assyria (vv.
10
–
12
) that will lead to the purification of Jerusalem’s inhabitants (vv.
13
–
16
). The text ends with an idealized portrait of the redeemed Jerusalem of the future (vv.
17
–
24
).
* [

Ariel…Shalem
: Jerusalem; cf.
29:1
;
Gn 14:18
;
Ps 76:3
. There is a play on words between “Shalem,” the city name, and
shalom
, Heb. for “peace.”
* [
33:9
]
Sharon
: the fertile plain near the Mediterranean.
* [
33:17
]
King
: either the ideal Davidic king or God; cf. v.
22
.
* [
33:21
–
23
]
Galley…majestic ship
: of a foreign oppressor. Though the broad streams of the future Jerusalem will make it accessible by boat, no foreign invader will succeed in a naval attack on the city, for the Lord will protect it, the enemy fleet will be disabled, and even the weakest inhabitants will gather much plunder from the defeated enemy.
