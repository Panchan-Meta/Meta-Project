PSALM 122
*
A Pilgrim’s Prayer for Jerusalem
1
A song of ascents. Of David.
I
I rejoiced when they said to me,
“Let us go to the house of the L
ORD
.”
a
2
And now our feet are standing
within your gates, Jerusalem.
3
Jerusalem, built as a city,
walled round about.
*
b
4
There the tribes go up,
the tribes of the L
ORD
,
As it was decreed for Israel,
to give thanks to the name of the L
ORD
.
c
5
There are the thrones of justice,
the thrones of the house of David.
II
6
For the peace of Jerusalem pray:
“May those who love you prosper!
7
May peace be within your ramparts,
prosperity within your towers.”
d
8
For the sake of my brothers and friends I say,
“Peace be with you.”
e
9
For the sake of the house of the L
ORD
, our God,
I pray for your good.
* [
Psalm 122
] A song of Zion, sung by pilgrims obeying the law to visit Jerusalem three times on a journey. The singer anticipates joining the procession into the city (
Ps 122:1
–
3
). Jerusalem is a place of encounter, where the people praise God (
Ps 122:4
) and hear the divine justice mediated by the king (
Ps 122:5
). The very buildings bespeak God’s power (cf.
Ps 48:13
–
15
). May the grace of this place transform the people’s lives (
Ps 122:6
–
9
)!
* [
122:3
]
Walled round about
: lit., “which is joined to it,” probably referring both to the density of the buildings and to the dense population.
