PSALM 141
*
Prayer for Deliverance from the Wicked
1
A psalm of David.
L
ORD
, I call to you; hasten to me;
listen to my plea when I call.
2
Let my prayer be incense
*
before you;
my uplifted hands
*
an evening offering.
a
3
Set a guard, L
ORD
, before my mouth,
keep watch over the door of my lips.
b
4
Do not let my heart incline to evil,
to perform deeds in wickedness.
On the delicacies of evildoers
let me not feast.
5
*
Let a righteous person strike me; it is mercy if he reproves me.
Do not withhold oil from my head
c
while my prayer opposes their evil deeds.
6
May their leaders be cast over the cliff,
so that they hear that my speeches are pleasing.
7
Like the plowing and breaking up of the earth,
our bones are strewn at the mouth of Sheol.
8
For my eyes are upon you, O L
ORD
, my Lord;
d
in you I take refuge; do not take away my soul.
9
Guard me from the trap they have set for me,
from the snares of evildoers.
e
10
Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
while only I pass over them safely.
* [
