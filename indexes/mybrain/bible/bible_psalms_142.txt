PSALM 142
*
A Prayer in Time of Trouble
1
A
maskil
of David, when he was in the cave.
*
A prayer.
2
With my own voice I cry to the L
ORD
;
with my own voice I beseech the L
ORD
.
3
Before him I pour out my complaint,
tell of my distress in front of him.
4
When my spirit is faint within me,
a
you know my path.
b
As I go along this path,
they have hidden a trap for me.
c
5
I look to my right hand to see
d
that there is no one willing to acknowledge me.
My escape has perished;
no one cares for me.
6
I cry out to you, L
ORD
,
I say, You are my refuge,
e
my portion in the land of the living.
f
7
Listen to my cry for help,
for I am brought very low.
g
Rescue me from my pursuers,
for they are too strong for me.
8
Lead my soul from prison,
that I may give thanks to your name.
Then the righteous shall gather around me
*
because you have been good to me.
* [
Psalm 142
] In this lament imploring God for help (
Ps 142:2
–
4
), the psalmist tells how enemies have set a trap (
Ps 142:4
–
5
), and prays for rescue (
Ps 142:6
–
8
). The speaker feels utterly alone (
Ps 142:5
), exhausted (
Ps 142:7
), and may even be imprisoned (
Ps 142:7
). Prison is possibly a metaphor for general distress. The last two verses are the vow of praise, made after receiving an assurance of divine help (
Ps 142:7
).
* [
142:1
]
In the cave
: cf.
1 Sm 22:1
;
24:1
–
3
;
Ps 57:1
.
* [
142:8
]
Then the righteous shall gather around me
: in the Temple, when the psalmist offers a thanksgiving sacrifice.
