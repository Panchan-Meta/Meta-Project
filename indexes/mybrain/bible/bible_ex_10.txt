CHAPTER 10
Eighth Plague: The Locusts.
1
Then the L
ORD
said to Moses: Go to Pharaoh, for I have made him and his servants obstinate in order that I may perform these signs of mine among them
2
and that you may recount to your son and grandson how I made a fool of the Egyptians and what signs I did among them, so that you may know that I am the L
ORD
.
a
3
So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and told him, “Thus says the L
ORD
, the God of the Hebrews: How long will you refuse to submit to me? Let my people go to serve me.
4
For if you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.
5
They will cover the surface of the earth, so that the earth itself will not be visible. They will eat up the remnant you saved undamaged from the hail, as well as all the trees that are growing in your fields.
6
They will fill your houses and the houses of your servants and of all the Egyptians—something your parents and your grandparents have not seen from the day they appeared on this soil until today.” With that he turned and left Pharaoh.
7
But Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will he be a snare for us? Let the people go to serve the L
ORD
, their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is being destroyed?”
8
So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, who said to them, “Go, serve the L
ORD
, your God. But who exactly will go?”
9
Moses answered, “With our young and old we must go; with our sons and daughters, with our flocks and herds we must go. It is a pilgrimage feast of the L
ORD
for us.”
10
“The L
ORD
help you,”
*
Pharaoh replied, “if I let your little ones go with you! Clearly, you have some evil in mind.
11
By no means! Just you men go and serve the L
ORD
.
*
After all, that is what you have been asking for.” With that they were driven from Pharaoh’s presence.
12
b
The L
ORD
then said to Moses: Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon it and eat up all the land’s vegetation, whatever the hail has left.
13
So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the L
ORD
drove an east wind
*
over the land all that day and all night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
14
The locusts came up over the whole land of Egypt and settled down over all its territory. Never before had there been such a fierce swarm of locusts, nor will there ever be again.
15
They covered the surface of the whole land, so that it became black. They ate up all the vegetation in the land and all the fruit of the trees the hail had spared. Nothing green was left on any tree or plant in the fields throughout the land of Egypt.
16
Pharaoh hurriedly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the L
ORD
, your God, and against you.
17
But now, do forgive me my sin only this once, and pray to the L
ORD
, your God, only to take this death from me.”
18
When Moses left Pharaoh, he prayed to the L
ORD
,
19
and the L
ORD
caused the wind to shift to a very strong west wind, which took up the locusts and hurled them into the Red Sea.
*
Not a single locust remained within the whole territory of Egypt.
20
Yet the L
ORD
hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.
Ninth Plague: The Darkness.
21
c
Then the L
ORD
said to Moses: Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that over the land of Egypt there may be such darkness
*
that one can feel it.
22
So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was dense darkness throughout the land of Egypt for three days.
23
People could not see one another, nor could they get up from where they were, for three days. But all the Israelites had light where they lived.
24
Pharaoh then summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, serve the L
ORD
. Only your flocks and herds will be detained. Even your little ones may go with you.”
25
But Moses replied, “You also must give us sacrifices and burnt offerings to make to the L
ORD
, our God.
26
Our livestock also must go with us. Not an animal must be left behind, for some of them we will select for service
*
to the L
ORD
, our God; but we will not know with which ones we are to serve the L
ORD
until we arrive there.”
27
But the L
ORD
hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was unwilling to let them go.
28
Pharaoh said to Moses, “Leave me, and see to it that you do not see my face again! For the day you do see my face you will die!”
29
Moses replied, “You are right! I will never see your face again.”
* [

The L
ORD
help you…
: lit., “May the Lord be with you in the same way as I let you…”; a sarcastic blessing intended as a curse.
* [
10:11
] Pharaoh realized that if the men alone went they would have to return to their families. He suspected that the Hebrews had no intention of returning.
* [
10:13
]
East wind
: coming across the desert from Arabia, the strong east wind brings Egypt the burning sirocco and, at times, locusts. Cf.
14:21
.
* [
10:19
]
The Red Sea
: the traditional translation, cf. Septuagint and other Versions; but the Hebrew literally means “sea of reeds” or “reedy sea,” which could probably be applied to a number of bodies of shallow water, most likely somewhat to the north of the present deep Red Sea.
* [
10:21
]
Darkness
: commentators note that at times a storm from the south, called the
khamsin
, blackens the sky of Egypt with sand from the Sahara; the dust in the air is then so thick that the darkness can, in a sense, “be felt.” But such observations should not obscure the fact that for the biblical author what transpires in each of the plagues is clearly something extraordinary, an event which witnesses to the unrivaled power of Israel’s God.
* [
10:26
]
Service
: as is obvious from v.
25
, the service in question here is the offering of sacrifice. The continued use of the verb
‘bd
“to serve” and related nouns for both the people’s bondage in Egypt and their subsequent service to the Lord dramatizes the point of the conflict between Pharaoh and the God of Israel, who demands from the Israelites an attachment which is exclusive. See
