f
24

] This list of army commanders is similar to, but distinct from, the list of David’s warriors given in
11:10
–
47
. The schematic enumeration of the soldiers presented here appears artificial and exaggerated (12 x 24,000 = 288,000 men!). However, the Hebrew word (
’eleph
) translated “thousand” might also designate a military unit of much smaller size.

After Ahithophel
: after Ahithophel’s suicide (
2 Sm 17:23
), Jehoiada succeeded him as the king’s counselor.
Abiathar
: David’s priest, along with Zadok. See note on
