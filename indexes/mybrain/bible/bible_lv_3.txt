g
* [
3:1
] The exact meaning of Hebrew
shelamim
, “communion sacrifice,” is not clear. It has also been rendered “gift,” “(re)payment,” “peace,” “well-being,” or “covenant” offering. This offering may be brought for a vow or voluntary offering (cf.
22:21
). A distinct version of the communion sacrifice is the thanksgiving offering (
7:11
–
15
vis-à-vis vv.
16
–
18
).
* [
3:3
–
5
]
Fat
: only part of the offering is devoted to God, as opposed to the burnt offering (chap.
1
), which is wholly burnt (except for the skin). The meat is distributed among the offerer (and the offerer’s party) and the priests (cf.
7:11
–
36
).
* [
3:17
]
Any fat or any blood
: this prohibition is mentioned here because portions of this offering could be eaten by lay Israelites, who may not be entirely familiar with the prohibition (cf.
7:22
–
27
;
19:26
). The fat prohibited is only the visceral fat mentioned in
3:9
–
10
,
14
–
15
, not muscular fat.
