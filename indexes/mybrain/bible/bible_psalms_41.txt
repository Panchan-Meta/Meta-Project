PSALM 41
*
Thanksgiving After Sickness
1
For the leader. A psalm of David.
I
2
Blessed the one concerned for the poor;
*
on a day of misfortune, the L
ORD
delivers him.
a
3
The L
ORD
keeps and preserves him,
makes him blessed in the land,
and does not betray him to his enemies.
4
The L
ORD
sustains him on his sickbed,
you turn down his bedding whenever he is ill.
*
II
5
Even I have said, “L
ORD
, take note of me;
heal me, although I have sinned against you.
6
My enemies say bad things against me:
‘When will he die and his name be forgotten?’
7
When someone comes to visit me, he speaks without sincerity.
His heart stores up malice;
when he leaves, he gossips.
b
8
All those who hate me whisper together against me;
they imagine the worst about me:
9
‘He has had ruin poured over him;
that one lying down will never rise again.’
10
*
Even my trusted friend,
who ate my bread,
has raised his heel against me.
c
III
11
“But you, L
ORD
, take note of me to raise me up
that I may repay them.”
*
12
By this I will know you are pleased with me,
that my enemy no longer shouts in triumph over me.
13
In my integrity may you support me
and let me stand in your presence forever.
14
*
Blessed be the L
ORD
, the God of Israel,
from all eternity and forever.
Amen. Amen.

* [
Psalm 41
] A thanksgiving for rescue from illness (
Ps 41:4
,
5
,
9
). Many people, even friends, have interpreted the illness as a divine punishment for sin and have ostracized the psalmist (
Ps 41:5
–
11
). The healing shows the return of God’s favor and rebukes the psalmist’s detractors (
Ps 41:12
–
13
).
* [
41:2
]
Blessed the one concerned for the poor
: cf.
Ps 32:1
–
2
;
34:9
;
40:5
;
65:5
. The psalmist’s statement about God’s love of the poor is based on the experience of being rescued (
Ps 41:1
–
3
).
* [
41:4
]
You turn down his bedding whenever he is ill
: the Hebrew is obscure. It suggests ongoing attentive care of the one who is sick.
* [
41:10
]
Even my trusted friendâ€¦has raised his heel against me
:
Jn 13:18
cites this verse to characterize Judas as a false friend.
Raised his heel against me
: an interpretation of the unclear Hebrew, “made great the heel against me.”
* [
41:11
]
That I may repay them
: the healing itself is an act of judgment through which God decides for the psalmist and against the false friends. The prayer is not necessarily for strength to punish enemies.
* [
41:14
] The doxology, not part of the Psalm, marks the end of the first of the five books of the Psalter, cf.
Ps 72:18
