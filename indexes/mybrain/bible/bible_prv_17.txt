CHAPTER 17
1
Better a dry crust with quiet
than a house full of feasting with strife.
*
2
A wise servant will rule over an unworthy son,
and will share the inheritance of the children.
*
3
The crucible for silver, and the furnace for gold,
but the tester of hearts is the L
ORD
.
4
The evildoer gives heed to wicked lips,
the liar, to a mischievous tongue.
5
Whoever mocks the poor reviles their Maker;
whoever rejoices in their misfortune will not go unpunished.
a
6
Children’s children are the crown of the elderly,
and the glory of children is their parentage.
7
Fine words ill fit a fool;
how much more lying lips, a noble!
8
A bribe seems a charm to its user;
at every turn it brings success.
*
9
Whoever overlooks an offense fosters friendship,
but whoever gossips about it separates friends.
*
10
A single reprimand does more for a discerning person
than a hundred lashes for a fool.
*
11
The wicked pursue only rebellion,
and a merciless messenger is sent against them.
*
12
Face a bear robbed of her cubs,
but never fools in their folly!
*
13
If you return evil for good,
evil will not depart from your house.
*
b
14
The start of strife is like the opening of a dam;
check a quarrel before it bursts forth!
15
Whoever acquits the wicked,
c
whoever condemns the just—
both are an abomination to the L
ORD
.
16
Of what use is money in the hands of fools
when they have no heart to acquire wisdom?
*
17
A friend is a friend at all times,
and a brother is born for the time of adversity.
d
18
Those without sense give their hands in pledge,
becoming surety for their neighbors.
e
19
Those who love an offense love a fight;
f
those who build their gate high
*
court disaster.
20
The perverse in heart come to no good,
and the double-tongued fall into trouble.
*
21
Whoever conceives a fool has grief;
the father of a numskull has no joy.
22
A joyful heart is the health of the body,
but a depressed spirit dries up the bones.
g
23
A guilty person takes out a bribe from the pocket,
thus perverting the course of justice.
*
24
On the countenance of a discerning person is wisdom,
h
but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.
*
25
A foolish son is vexation to his father,
and bitter sorrow to her who bore him.
i
26
It is wrong to fine an innocent person,
but beyond reason to scourge nobles.
27
Those who spare their words are truly knowledgeable,
and those who are discreet are intelligent.
j
28
Even fools, keeping silent, are considered wise;
if they keep their lips closed, intelligent.
*
* [
17:1
] A “better than” saying, stating the circumstances when a dry crust is better than a banquet. Peace and fellowship give joy to a meal, not the richness of the food. For a similar thought, see
15:16
and
16:8
.
* [
17:2
] Ability is esteemed more highly than ties of blood.
* [
17:8
] An observation on the effect of the bribe upon the bribe-giver: it gives an intoxicating feeling of power (“seems”). In v.
23
the evil effects of a bribe are noted.
* [
17:9
] A paradox. One finds (love, friend) by concealing (an offense), one loses (a friend) by revealing (a secret). In
10:12
love also covers over a multitude of offenses.
* [
17:10
] A wonderful comment on the openness and sensitivity of the wise and the foolish. One type learns from a single word and for the other one hundred blows are not enough.
* [
17:11
] The irony is that such people will meet up with what they so energetically pursue—in the form of an unrelenting emissary sent to them.
* [
17:12
] Humorous hyperbole. An outraged dangerous beast poses less danger than a fool.
* [
17:13
] The paradox is that to pay out evil for good means that the evil will never leave one’s own house.
* [
17:16
] The exhortation to acquire or purchase wisdom is common in Proverbs. Fools misunderstand the metaphor, assuming they can buy it with money. Their very misunderstanding shows they have no “heart” = mind, understanding. Money in the hand is no good without such a “heart” to store it in.
* [
17:19
]
Build their gate high
: a symbol of arrogance.
* [
17:20
] The saying employs the familiar metaphors of walking = conducting oneself (“fall into trouble”), and of straight and crooked = right and wrong (“perverse,” “double-tongued”).
* [
17:23
] A sharp look at the sly withdrawing of a bribe from the pocket and a blunt judgment on its significance.
* [
17:24
] Wisdom is visible on the countenance (i.e., mouth, lips, tongue) of the wise person; its ultimate source is the heart. Fools have no such source of wisdom within them, a point that is nicely made by referring to the eye of the fool, roving over the landscape.
* [
17:28
] Related to v.
27
. Words provide a glimpse into the heart. In the unlikely event that fools, who usually pour out words (
15:2
), were to say nothing, people would not be able to see their folly and would presume them intelligent. Alas, the saying is contrary to fact.
