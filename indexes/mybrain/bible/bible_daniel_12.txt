CHAPTER 12
The Resurrection
1
“At that time there shall arise Michael,
a
the great prince,
guardian of your people;
It shall be a time unsurpassed in distress
since the nation began until that time.
At that time your people shall escape,
everyone who is found written in the book.
*
2
Many of those who sleep
*
in the dust of the earth shall awake;
Some to everlasting life,
others to reproach and everlasting disgrace.
b
3
But those with insight shall shine brightly
like the splendor of the firmament,
And those who lead the many to justice
shall be like the stars
*
forever.
c
4
“As for you, Daniel, keep secret the message and seal the book until the end time; many shall wander aimlessly and evil shall increase.”
5
I, Daniel, looked and saw two others, one standing on either bank of the river.
6
One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was upstream, “How long shall it be to the end of these appalling things?”
7
The man clothed in linen,
d
who was upstream, lifted his hands to heaven; and I heard him swear by him who lives forever that it should be for a time, two times, and half a time;
*
and that, when the power of the destroyer of the holy people was brought to an end, all these things should end.
8
I heard, but I did not understand; so I asked, “My lord, what follows this?”
9
“Go, Daniel,” he said, “because the words are to be kept secret and sealed until the end time.
10
Many shall be refined, purified, and tested, but the wicked shall prove wicked; the wicked shall have no understanding, but those with insight shall.
11
*
From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the desolating abomination is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days.
12
Blessed are they who have patience and persevere for the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.
13
Go, take your rest, you shall rise for your reward at the end of days.”

Many of those who sleep
: Daniel does not envisage the universal resurrection as later developed. Two groups are distinguished, one that rises to eternal life, the other to reproach and disgrace. Then “those with insight” (
11:33
–
35
) are singled out for special honor.
* [

Like the stars
: like the heavenly host, or angels. Cf.
Mt 22:30

A time, two times, and half a time
: see note on

* [

] The specific numbers of days given in vv.

–

represent attempts to calculate the precise duration of the three and a half years. Most probably, when the first date (1,290 days) passed, the author attempted another calculation. Another, earlier calculation is preserved in
8:14
. It is noteworthy, however, that the contradictory numbers were allowed to stand in the text; this is a reminder that it is not possible to calculate a precise date for God’s judgment; cf.
Mk 13:32
