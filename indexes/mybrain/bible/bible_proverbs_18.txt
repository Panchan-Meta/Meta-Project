CHAPTER 18
1
One who is alienated seeks a pretext,
with all persistence picks a quarrel.
2
Fools take no delight in understanding,
but only in displaying what they think.
*
3
With wickedness comes contempt,
and with disgrace, scorn.
4
The words of one’s mouth are deep waters,
the spring of wisdom, a running brook.
*
a
5
It is not good to favor the guilty,
nor to reject the claim of the just.
b
6
The lips of fools walk into a fight,
and their mouths are asking for a beating.
*
7
The mouths of fools are their ruin;
their lips are a deadly snare.
c
8
The words of a talebearer are like dainty morsels:
they sink into one’s inmost being.
d
9
Those slack in their work
are kin to the destroyer.
10
*
The name of the L
ORD
is a strong tower;
the just run to it and are safe.
11
The wealth of the rich is their strong city;
e
they fancy it a high wall.
12
Before disaster the heart is haughty,
f
but before honor is humility.
13
Whoever answers before listening,
g
theirs is folly and shame.
*
14
One’s spirit supports one when ill,
but a broken spirit who can bear?
*
15
The heart of the intelligent acquires knowledge,
and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
*
16
Gifts clear the way for people,
winning access to the great.
h
17
Those who plead the case first seem to be in the right;
then the opponent comes and cross-examines them.
*
18
The lot puts an end to disputes,
and decides a controversy between the mighty.
*
19
A brother offended is more unyielding than a stronghold;
such strife is more daunting than castle gates.
*
20
With the fruit of one’s mouth one’s belly is filled,
with the produce of one’s lips one is sated.
*
i
21
Death and life are in the power of the tongue;
j
those who choose one shall eat its fruit.
*
22
To find a wife is to find happiness,
a favor granted by the L
ORD
.
k
23
The poor implore,
but the rich answer harshly.
24
There are friends who bring ruin,
but there are true friends more loyal than a brother.

* [
18:2
] One grows in wisdom by listening to others, but fools take delight in expounding the contents of their minds.
* [
18:4
] Words express a person’s thoughts (“deep waters”), which in turn become accessible to others. Cf.
20:5a
.
* [
18:6
] The bold personification of lips and mouth is similar to
Ps 73:9
, “They set their mouths against the heavens, their tongues roam the earth.” Careless words can lead one into serious trouble.
* [
18:10
–
11
] Contrast this judgment with the observation in
10:15
.
* [
18:13
] To speak without first listening is characteristic of a fool; cf.
10:14
;
Sir 11:8
.
* [
18:14
] The paradox is that something as slight as a column of air offers protection against the encroachment of death. If it is stilled, nothing, no matter how powerful, can substitute for it.
* [
18:15
] “Knowledge” here refers to what one knows, not knowledge in itself. The mind acquires and stores it, the ear strains toward it.
* [
18:17
] A persuasive speech in court can easily make one forget there is another side to the question. When the other party speaks, people realize they made a premature judgment. The experience at court is a lesson for daily life: there are two sides to every question.
* [
18:18
] See note on
16:33
.
* [
18:19
] The Greek version, followed by several ancient versions, has the opposite meaning: “A brother helped by a brother is like a strong and lofty city; it is strong like a well-founded palace.” The Greek is secondary as is shown by the need to supply the phrase “by a brother”; further, the parallelism is inadequate. The Hebrew is to be preferred.
* [
18:20
] Fruit from the earth is our ordinary sustenance, but “the fruit of one’s lips,” i.e., our words, also affect our well-being. If our words and our deeds are right, then we are blessed, our “belly is filled.”
* [
18:21
] This enigmatic saying has provoked many interpretations, e.g., judicious speech brings a reward; those who love the tongue in the sense of rattling on must face the consequences of their loquacity. This translation interprets the verb “love” in colon B in its occasional sense of “choose” (e.g.,
12:1
;
20:13
;
Dt 4:37
) and interprets its pronominal object as referring to both death and life in colon A. Death and life are set before every person (cf.
Dt 30:15
–
20
) and we have the power to choose either one by the quality of our deeds. Words (= “the tongue”) are regarded here as the defining actions of human beings.
