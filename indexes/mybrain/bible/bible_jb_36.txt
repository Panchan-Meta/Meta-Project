CHAPTER 36
1
Elihu continued and said:
2
Wait a little and I will instruct you,
for there are still words to be said for God.
3
I will assemble arguments from afar,
and for my maker I will establish what is right.
4
For indeed, my words are not a lie;
one perfect in knowledge is before you.
5
Look, God is great, not disdainful;
his strength of purpose is great.
He does not preserve the life of the wicked.
6
He establishes the right of the poor;
a
he does not divert his eyes from the just
7
But he seats them upon thrones
with kings, exalted forever.
b
8
If they are bound with fetters,
held fast by bonds of affliction,
9
He lets them know what they have done,
and how arrogant are their sins.
10
He opens their ears to correction
and tells them to turn back from evil.
11
If they listen and serve him,
they spend their days in prosperity,
their years in happiness.
12
But if they do not listen, they pass to the grave,
they perish for lack of knowledge.
13
The impious in heart lay up anger;
they do not cry for help when he binds them;
14
They will die young—
their life
*
among the reprobate.
15
But he saves the afflicted through their affliction,
and opens their ears through oppression.
16
*
He entices you from distress,
to a broad place without constraint;
what rests on your table is rich food.
17
Though you are full of the judgment of the wicked,
judgment and justice will be maintained.
18
Let not anger at abundance entice you,
nor great bribery lead you astray.
19
Will your wealth equip you against distress,
or all your exertions of strength?
20
Do not long for the night,
when peoples vanish in their place.
21
Be careful; do not turn to evil;
for this you have preferred to affliction.
22
*
Look, God is exalted in his power.
What teacher is there like him?
23
Who prescribes for him his way?
Who says, “You have done wrong”?
c
24
Remember, you should extol his work,
which people have praised in song.
25
All humankind beholds it;
everyone views it from afar.
26
See, God is great beyond our knowledge,
the number of his years past searching out.
27
He holds in check the waterdrops
that filter in rain from his flood,
28
Till the clouds flow with them
and they rain down on all humankind.
29
*
Can anyone understand the spreading clouds,
the thunderings from his tent?
30
Look, he spreads his light over it,
it covers the roots of the sea.
31
For by these he judges the nations,
and gives food in abundance.
32
In his hands he holds the lightning,
and he commands it to strike the mark.
33
His thunder announces him
and incites the fury of the storm.
