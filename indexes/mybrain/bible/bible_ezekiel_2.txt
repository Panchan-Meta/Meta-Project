CHAPTER 2
Eating of the Scroll.
1
The voice said to me: Son of man,
*
stand up! I wish to speak to you.
2
As he spoke to me, the spirit
*
entered into me and set me on my feet, and I heard the one who was speaking
a
3
say to me: Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day.
b
4
Their children are bold of face and stubborn of heart—to them I am sending you. You shall say to them: Thus says the Lord G
OD
.
c
5
And whether they hear or resist—they are a rebellious house—they shall know that a prophet has been among them.
d
6
But as for you, son of man, do not fear them or their words. Do not fear, even though there are briers or thorns and you sit among scorpions.
*
Do not be afraid of their words or be terrified by their looks for they are a rebellious house.
e
7
You must speak my words to them, whether they hear or resist, because they are rebellious.
f
8
But you, son of man, hear me when I speak to you and do not rebel like this rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.

h
It was then I saw a hand stretched out to me; in it was a written scroll.
10
He unrolled it before me; it was covered with writing front and back. Written on it was: Lamentation, wailing, woe!

* [
2:1
]
Son of man
: in Hebrew, “son/daughter of…” is a common idiom expressing affiliation in a group; in this case, “a human being.” The title is God’s habitual way of addressing the prophet throughout this book, probably used to emphasize the separation of the divine and the human.
* [
2:2
]
The spirit
: lit., wind, breath; a vital power, coming from God, which enables the prophet to hear the divine word; cf.
8:3
;
11:1
,
24
.
* [
2:6
]
And you sit among scorpions
: the prophet must be prepared for bitter opposition.
