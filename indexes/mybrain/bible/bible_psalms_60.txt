PSALM 60
*
Lament After Defeat in Battle
1
For the leader; according to “The Lily of.â€¦” A
miktam
of David (for teaching),
2
when he fought against Aram-Naharaim and Aram-Zobah; and Joab, coming back, killed twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
a
I
3
O God, you rejected us, broke our defenses;
you were angry but now revive us.
4
You rocked the earth, split it open;
b
repair the cracks for it totters.
5
You made your people go through hardship,
made us stagger from the wine you gave us.
c
6
Raise up a banner for those who revere you,
a refuge for them out of bow shot.
Selah
7
*
Help with your right hand and answer us
that your loved ones may escape.
II
8
*
In the sanctuary God promised:
“I will exult, will apportion Shechem;
the valley of Succoth
*
I will measure out.
9
Gilead is mine, mine is Manasseh;
Ephraim is the helmet for my head,
Judah, my own scepter.
*
10
*
Moab is my washbowl;
upon Edom I cast my sandal.
*
d
I will triumph over Philistia.”
III
11
Who will bring me to the fortified city?
*
Who will lead me into Edom?
12
Was it not you who rejected us, God?
Do you no longer march with our armies?
e
13
Give us aid against the foe;
worthless is human help.
14
We will triumph with the help of God,
who will trample down our foes.
* [
Psalm 60
] The community complains that God has let the enemy win the battle (
Ps 60:3
–
5
) and asks for an assurance of victory (
Ps 60:6
–
7
). In the oracle God affirms ownership of the land; the invasion of other nations is not permanent and will be reversed ultimately (
Ps 60:8
–
10
). With renewed confidence, the community resolves to fight again (
Ps 60:11
). The opening lament is picked up again (
Ps 60:12
), but this time with new awareness of God’s power and human limitation.
* [
60:7
–
12
] These verses occur again as the second half of
Ps 108
.
* [
60:8
]
I willâ€¦apportionâ€¦measure out
: God lays claim to these places.
The valley of Succoth
: probably the lower stretch of the Jabbok valley.
* [
60:9
]
Judah, my own scepter
: an allusion to the Testament of Jacob,
Gn 49:10
.
* [
60:10
]
Moab is my washbowl
: Moab borders the Dead Sea, hence a metaphor for the country.
Upon Edom I cast my sandal
: an ancient legal gesture of taking possession of land.
* [
60:11
]
The fortified city
: perhaps Bozrah, the fortified capital of Edom, cf.
Is 34:6
;
63:1
;
Am 1:12
.
