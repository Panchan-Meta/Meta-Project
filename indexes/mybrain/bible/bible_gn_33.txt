CHAPTER 33
Jacob and Esau Meet.
*
1
Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming, and with him four hundred men. So he divided his children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants,
2
putting the maidservants and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.
3
He himself went on ahead of them, bowing to the ground seven times, until he reached his brother.
4
Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, and flinging himself on his neck, kissed him as he wept.
5
Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children and asked, “Who are these with you?” Jacob answered, “They are the children with whom God has graciously favored your servant.”
6
Then the maidservants and their children came forward and bowed low;
7
next, Leah and her children came forward and bowed low; lastly, Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed low.
8
Then Esau asked, “What did you intend with all those herds that I encountered?” Jacob answered, “It was to gain my lord’s favor.”
9
Esau replied, “I have plenty; my brother, you should keep what is yours.”
10
“No, I beg you!” said Jacob. “If you will do me the favor, accept this gift from me, since to see your face is for me like seeing the face of God—and you have received me so kindly.
11
Accept the gift I have brought you. For God has been generous toward me, and I have an abundance.” Since he urged him strongly, Esau accepted.
12
Then Esau said, “Let us break camp and be on our way; I will travel in front of you.”
13
But Jacob replied: “As my lord knows, the children are too young. And the flocks and herds that are nursing are a concern to me; if overdriven for even a single day, the whole flock will die.
14
Let my lord, then, go before his servant, while I proceed more slowly at the pace of the livestock before me and at the pace of my children, until I join my lord in Seir.”
15
Esau replied, “Let me at least put at your disposal some of the people who are with me.” But Jacob said, “Why is this that I am treated so kindly, my lord?”
16
So on that day Esau went on his way back to Seir,
17
and Jacob broke camp for Succoth.
*
There Jacob built a home for himself and made booths for his livestock. That is why the place was named Succoth.
18
Jacob arrived safely at the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram. He encamped in sight of the city.

19
The plot of ground on which he had pitched his tent he bought for a hundred pieces of money
*
from the descendants of Hamor, the father of Shechem.

20
He set up an altar there and invoked “El, the God of Israel.”
c
* [
33:1
–
20
] The truly frightening confrontation seems to have already occurred in Jacob’s meeting the divine stranger in the previous chapter. In contrast, this meeting brings reconciliation. Esau, impulsive but largehearted, kisses the cunning Jacob and calls him brother (v.
9
). Jacob in return asks Esau to accept his blessing (
berakah
, translated “gift,” v.
11
), giving back at least symbolically what he had taken many years before and responding to Esau’s erstwhile complaint (“he has taken away my blessing,”
27:36
). Verses
12
–
17
show that the reconciliation is not total and, further, that Jacob does not intend to share the ancestral land with his brother.

Succoth
: an important town near the confluence of the Jabbok and the Jordan (
Jos 13:27
;
Jgs 8:5
–

Booths
: in Hebrew,
sukkot
, of the same sound as the name of the town.
* [
33:19

Pieces of money
: in Hebrew,
qesita
, a monetary unit of which the value is unknown.
Descendants of Hamor
: Hamorites, “the people of Hamor”; cf.

. Hamor was regarded as the eponymous ancestor of the pre-Israelite inhabitants of Shechem.
