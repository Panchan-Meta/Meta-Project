* [
Psalm 150
] The Psalm is a closing doxology both for the fifth book of the Psalms (
Ps 107
–
149
) and for the Psalter as a whole. Temple musicians and dancers are called to lead all beings on earth and in heaven in praise of God. The Psalm proclaims to whom praise shall be given, and where (
Ps 150:1
); what praise shall be given, and why (
Ps 150:2
); how praise shall be given (
Ps 150:3
–
5
), and by whom (
Ps 150:6
).
* [
150:1
]
His holy sanctuary
: God’s Temple on earth.
The mighty dome of heaven
: lit., “[God’s] strong vault”; heaven is here imagined as a giant plate separating the inhabited world from the waters of the heavens.
