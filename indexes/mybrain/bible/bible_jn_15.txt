CHAPTER 15
The Vine and the Branches.
1
*
“I am the true vine,
*
and my Father is the vine grower.
a
2
He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit, and every one that does he prunes
*
so that it bears more fruit.
3
You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you.
b
4
Remain in me, as I remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me.
5
I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit, because without me you can do nothing.
6
*
c
Anyone who does not remain in me will be thrown out like a branch and wither; people will gather them and throw them into a fire and they will be burned.
7
If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you.
d
8
By this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples.
e
9
As the Father loves me, so I also love you. Remain in my love.
f
10
If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love.
g
11
“I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.
h
12
This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.
i
13
*
No one has greater love than this,
j
to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.
14
You are my friends if you do what I command you.
15
I no longer call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends,
*
because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.
k
16
It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.
l
17
This I command you: love one another.
m
The World’s Hatred.
*
18
“If the world hates you, realize that it hated me first.
n
19
If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own; but because you do not belong to the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, the world hates you.
o
20
Remember the word I spoke to you,
*
‘No slave is greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.
p
21
And they will do all these things to you on account of my name,
*
because they do not know the one who sent me.
q
22
If I had not come and spoken
*
to them, they would have no sin; but as it is they have no excuse for their sin.
r
23
Whoever hates me also hates my Father.
s
24
If I had not done works among them that no one else ever did, they would not have sin; but as it is, they have seen and hated both me and my Father.
t
25
But in order that the word written in their law
*
might be fulfilled, ‘They hated me without cause.’
u
26
“When the Advocate comes whom I will send
*
you from the Father, the Spirit of truth that proceeds from the Father, he will testify to me.
v
27
And you also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
w
* [
15:1
–
16:4
] Discourse on the union of Jesus with his disciples. His words become a monologue and go beyond the immediate crisis of the departure of Jesus.
* [
15:1
–
17
] Like
Jn 10:1
–
5
, this passage resembles a parable. Israel is spoken of as a vineyard at
Is 5:1
–
7
;
Mt 21:33
–
46
and as a vine at
Ps 80:9
–
17
;
Jer 2:21
;
Ez 15:2
;
17:5
–
10
;
19:10
;
Hos 10:1
. The identification of the vine as the Son of Man in
Ps 80:15
and Wisdom’s description of herself as a vine in
Sir 24:17
are further background for portrayal of Jesus by this figure. There may be secondary eucharistic symbolism here; cf.
Mk 14:25
, “the fruit of the vine.”
* [
15:2
]
Takes away,prunes
: in Greek there is a play on two related verbs.
* [
15:6
] Branches were cut off and dried on the wall of the vineyard for later use as fuel.
* [
15:13
]
For one’s friends
: or: “those whom one loves.” In
Jn 15:9
–
13a
, the words for love are related to the Greek
agapaō
. In
Jn 15:13b
–
15
, the words for love are related to the Greek
phileō
. For John, the two roots seem synonymous and mean “to love”; cf. also
Jn 21:15
–
17
. The word
philos
is used here.
* [
15:15
]
Slaves,friends
: in the Old Testament, Moses (
Dt 34:5
), Joshua (
Jos 24:29
), and David (
Ps 89:21
) were called “servants” or “slaves of Yahweh”; only Abraham (
Is 41:8
;
2 Chr 20:7
; cf.
Jas 2:23
) was called a “friend of God.”
* [
15:18
–
16:4
] The hostile reaction of the world. There are synoptic parallels, predicting persecution, especially at
Mt 10:17
–
25
;
24:9
–
10
.
* [
15:20
]
The word I spoke to you
: a reference to
Jn 13:16
.
* [
15:21
]
On account of my name
: the idea of persecution for Jesus’ name is frequent in the New Testament (
Mt 10:22
;
24:9
;
Acts 9:14
). For John, association with Jesus’ name implies union with Jesus.
* [
15:22
,
24
] Jesus’ words (
spoken
) and deeds (
works
) are the great motives of credibility.
They have seen and hated
: probably means that they have seen his works and still have hated; but the Greek can be read: “have seen both me and my Father and still have hated both me and my Father.”
Works,that no one else ever did
: so Yahweh in
Dt 4:32
–
33
.
* [
15:25
]
In their law
: law is here used as a larger concept than the Pentateuch, for the reference is to
Ps 35:19
or
Ps 69:5
. See notes on
Jn 10:34
;
12:34
.
Their
law reflects the argument of the church with the synagogue.
* [
15:26
]
Whom I will send
: in
Jn 14:16
,
26
, the Paraclete is to be sent by the Father, at the request of Jesus. Here the Spirit comes from both Jesus and the Father in mission; there is no reference here to the eternal procession of the Spirit.
