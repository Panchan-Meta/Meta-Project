CHAPTER 50
Simeon, Son of Jochanan
1
Greatest of his family, the glory of his people,
was S
IMEON
the priest, son of Jochanan,
*
In whose time the house of God was renovated,
in whose days the temple was reinforced.
2
In his time also the retaining wall was built
with powerful turrets for the temple precincts.
3
In his time the reservoir was dug,
a pool as vast as the sea.
4
He protected the people against brigands
and strengthened the city against the enemy.
5
How splendid he was as he looked out from the tent,
as he came from behind the veil!
6
Like a star shining among the clouds,
like the full moon at the festal season;
7
Like sun shining upon the temple of the King,
like a rainbow appearing in the cloudy sky;
8
Like blossoms on the branches in springtime,
like a lily by running waters;
Like a green shoot on Lebanon in summer,
9
like the fire of incense at sacrifice;
Like a vessel of hammered gold,
studded with all kinds of precious stones;
10
Like a luxuriant olive tree heavy with fruit,
a plant with branches abounding in oil;
11
Wearing his glorious robes,
and vested in sublime magnificence,
a
As he ascended the glorious altar
and lent majesty to the court of the sanctuary.
12
When he received the portions from the priests
while he stood before the sacrificial wood,
His sons stood round him like a garland,
like young cedars on Lebanon;
And like poplars by the brook they surrounded him,
13
all the sons of Aaron in their glory,
With the offerings to the L
ORD
in their hands,
in the presence of the whole assembly of Israel.
14
Once he had completed the service at the altar
and arranged the sacrificial hearth for the Most High,
15
And had stretched forth his hand for the cup,
to offer blood of the grape,
And poured it out at the foot of the altar,
a sweet-smelling odor to God the Most High,
b
16
Then the sons of Aaron would sound a blast,
the priests, on their trumpets of beaten metal;
A blast to resound mightily
as a reminder before the Most High.
c
17
All the people with one accord
would fall with face to the ground
In adoration before the Most High,
before the Holy One of Israel.
18
Then hymns would re-echo,
and over the throng sweet strains of praise resound.
19
All the people of the land would shout for joy,
praying to the Merciful One,
As the high priest completed the service at the altar
by presenting to God the fitting sacrifice.
20
Then coming down he would raise his hands
over all the congregation of Israel;
The blessing of the L
ORD
would be upon his lips,
the name of the L
ORD
would be his glory.
d
21
The people would again fall down
to receive the blessing of the Most High.
22
And now, bless the God of all,
*
who has done wonders on earth;
Who fosters growth from the womb,
fashioning it according to his will!
23
May he grant you a wise heart
and abide with you in peace;
24
May his goodness toward Simeon last forever;
may he fulfill for him the covenant with Phinehas
So that it may not be abrogated for him
or his descendants while the heavens last.
Epilogue
25
My whole being loathes two nations,
the third is not even a people:
*
26
The inhabitants of Seir
*
and Philistia,
and the foolish people who dwell in Shechem.
e
27
Wise instruction, appropriate proverbs,
*
I have written in this book—
I, Yeshua Ben Eleazar Ben Sira—
as they poured forth from my heart’s understanding.
28
Happy those who meditate upon these things;
wise those who take them to heart!
29
If they put them into practice, they can cope with anything,
for the fear of the L
ORD
is their lamp.

Son of Jochanan
: Simeon II, in whose time as high priest (219–196 B.C.) great works were accomplished for the benefit of public worship and welfare (vv.
1
–
4
). Ben Sira, a contemporary, describes detailed liturgical action, perhaps pertaining to the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur, cf.
Lv 16
).
* [
50:22
–
24
] Ben Sira urges the reader to praise and bless God for his wondrous works and then invokes a blessing on all that they may enjoy peace and gladness of heart and the abiding goodness of the Most High.

Not even a people
: the Samaritans.
* [

Seir
: Mount Seir in the territory of the Edomites.
Shechem
: a city in Samaria.

] This colophon may have been the original ending of the book. It is unusual for a biblical writer to append his name.
