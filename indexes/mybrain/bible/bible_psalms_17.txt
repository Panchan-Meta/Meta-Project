PSALM 17
*
Prayer for Rescue from Persecutors
1
A prayer of David.
I
Hear, L
ORD
, my plea for justice;
pay heed to my cry;
Listen to my prayer
from lips without guile.
2
From you let my vindication come;
your eyes see what is right.
3
You have tested my heart,
searched it in the night.
a
You have tried me by fire,
but find no malice in me.
My mouth has not transgressed
4
as others often do.
As your lips have instructed me,
I have kept from the way of the lawless.
5
My steps have kept to your paths;
my feet have not faltered.
b
II
6
I call upon you; answer me, O God.
Turn your ear to me; hear my speech.
7
Show your wonderful mercy,
you who deliver with your right arm
those who seek refuge from their foes.
8
*
Keep me as the apple of your eye;
hide me in the shadow of your wings
9
from the wicked who despoil me.
c
III
My ravenous enemies press upon me;
d
10
*
they close their hearts,
they fill their mouths with proud roaring.
11
Their steps even now encircle me;
they watch closely, keeping low to the ground,
12
Like lions eager for prey,
like a young lion lurking in ambush.
13
Rise, O L
ORD
, confront and cast them down;
rescue my soul from the wicked.
14
Slay them with your sword;
with your hand, L
ORD
, slay them;
snatch them from the world in their prime.
Their bellies are being filled with your friends;
their children are satisfied too,
for they share what is left with their young.
15
I am just—let me see your face;
when I awake, let me be filled with your presence.

* [
Psalm 17
] A lament of an individual unjustly attacked. Confident of being found innocent, the psalmist cries out for God’s just judgment (
Ps 17:1
–
5
) and requests divine help against enemies (
Ps 17:6
–
9a
). Those ravenous lions (
Ps 17:9b
–
12
) should be punished (
Ps 17:13
–
14
). The Psalm ends with a serene statement of praise (
Ps 17:15
). The Hebrew text of
Ps 17:3
–
4
,
14
is uncertain.
* [
