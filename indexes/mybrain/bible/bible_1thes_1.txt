CHAPTER 1
Greeting.
1
*
a
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: grace to you and peace.
Thanksgiving for Their Faith.
2
We give thanks to God always for all of you, remembering you in our prayers, unceasingly
b
3
calling to mind your work of faith and labor of love and endurance in hope
*
of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father,
4
knowing, brothers loved by God, how you were chosen.
c
5
For our gospel did not come to you in word alone, but also in power and in the holy Spirit and [with] much conviction. You know what sort of people we were [among] you for your sake.
d
6
And you became imitators
*
of us and of the Lord, receiving the word in great affliction, with joy from the holy Spirit,
7
so that you became a model for all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
e
8
For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth not only in Macedonia and [in] Achaia, but in every place your faith in God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything.
f
9
For they themselves openly declare about us what sort of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God
g
10
and to await his Son from heaven, whom he raised from [the] dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the coming wrath.

Faith…love…hope
: this, along with
1 Thes 5:8
, is the earliest mention in Christian literature of the three “theological virtues” (see
1 Cor 13:13
). The order here stresses eschatological hope, in line with the letter’s emphasis on the Lord’s second, triumphal coming, or parousia (
1 Thes 1:10
;
2:12
,
19
;
3:13
;
4:13
–
5:11
;
5:23
).

Imitators
: the Pauline theme of “imitation” (see
1 Thes 2:14
;
1 Cor 4:16
;
11:1
;
2 Thes 3:9
) is rooted in Paul’s view of solidarity in Christ through sharing in Jesus’ cross and in the Spirit of the risen Lord.
