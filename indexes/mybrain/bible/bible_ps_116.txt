PSALM 116
*
Thanksgiving to God Who Saves from Death
I
1
I love the L
ORD
, who listened
to my voice in supplication,
2
Who turned an ear to me
on the day I called.
3
I was caught by the cords of death;
*
a
the snares of Sheol had seized me;
I felt agony and dread.
4
Then I called on the name of the L
ORD
,
“O L
ORD
, save my life!”
II
5
Gracious is the L
ORD
and righteous;
yes, our God is merciful.
b
6
The L
ORD
protects the simple;
I was helpless, but he saved me.
7
Return, my soul, to your rest;
the L
ORD
has been very good to you.
c
8
For my soul has been freed from death,
my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
d
9
I shall walk before the L
ORD
in the land of the living.
*
e
III
10
*
I kept faith, even when I said,
“I am greatly afflicted!”
f
11
I said in my alarm,
“All men are liars!”
g
12
How can I repay the L
ORD
for all the great good done for me?
13
I will raise the cup of salvation
*
and call on the name of the L
ORD
.
14
I will pay my vows to the L
ORD
in the presence of all his people.
15
*
Dear in the eyes of the L
ORD
is the death of his devoted.
h
16
L
ORD
, I am your servant,
your servant, the child of your maidservant;
i
you have loosed my bonds.
17
I will offer a sacrifice of praise
and call on the name of the L
ORD
.
j
18
I will pay my vows to the L
ORD
k
in the presence of all his people,
19
In the courts of the house of the L
ORD
,
in your midst, O Jerusalem.
Hallelujah!
* [
Psalm 116
] A thanksgiving in which the psalmist responds to divine rescue from mortal danger (
Ps 116:3
–
4
) and from near despair (
Ps 116:10
–
11
) with vows and Temple sacrifices (
Ps 116:13
–
14
,
17
–
19
). The Greek and Latin versions divide the Psalm into two parts:
Ps 116:1
–
9
and
Ps 116:10
–
19
, corresponding to its two major divisions.
* [
116:3
]
The cords of death
: death is personified here; it attempts to capture the psalmist with snares and nets, cf.
Ps 18:6
.
* [
116:9
]
The land of the living
: the phrase elsewhere is an epithet of the Jerusalem Temple (cf.
Ps 27:13
;
52:5
;
Is 38:11
). Hence the psalmist probably refers to being present to God in the Temple.
* [
116:10
]
I kept faith, even when I said
: even in the days of despair, the psalmist did not lose all hope.
* [
116:13
]
The cup of salvation
: probably the libation of wine poured out in gratitude for rescue, cf.
Ex 25:29
;
Nm 15:5
,
7
,
10
.
* [
116:15
]
Dear in the eyes of the L
ORD
: the meaning is that the death of God’s faithful is grievous to God, not that God is pleased with the death, cf.
Ps 72:14
. In
Wis 3:5
–
6
, God accepts the death of the righteous as a sacrificial burnt offering.
