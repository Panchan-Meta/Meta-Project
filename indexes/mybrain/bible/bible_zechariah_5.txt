CHAPTER 5
Fifth Vision: The Flying Scroll.
1
Then I raised my eyes again and saw a flying scroll.
2
He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.”
*
a
3
Then he said to me: “This is the curse which is to go forth over the whole land. According to it, every thief and every perjurer
*
will be expelled.
4
I will send it forth—oracle of the L
ORD
of hosts—so that it will come to the house of the thief, and into the house of the one who swears falsely by my name.
b
It shall lodge within each house, consuming it, timber and stones.”
Sixth Vision: The Basket of Wickedness.
5
Then the angel who spoke with me came forward and said to me, “Raise your eyes and look. What is this that comes forth?”
6
I said, “What is it?” And he answered, “This is the basket
*
that is coming.” And he said, “This is their guilt in all the land.”
7
Then a leaden cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting inside the basket.
*
8
He said, “This is Wickedness,” and he thrust her inside the basket, pushing the leaden weight into the opening.
9
Then I raised my eyes and saw two women coming forth with wind under their wings
*
—they had wings like the wings of a stork—and they lifted the basket into the air.
10
I said to the angel who spoke with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”
11
He replied, “To build a temple for it in the land of Shinar.
*
When the temple is constructed, they will set it there on its base.”
* [
5:2
]
Twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide
: ca. thirty feet by fifteen feet. These dimensions may represent the ratio of height to width in the exposed portion of a scroll being opened for liturgical reading; at the same time it may symbolize the approach to God’s presence since the entryway to the Temple has the same measurements (
1 Kgs 6:3
). The scroll itself may represent God’s covenant with the people, insofar as it contains curses against those who break the law.
* [
5:3
]
Thief…perjurer
: a pair of miscreants representing all those who disobey God’s covenant (see note on v.
2
) and who must therefore be punished according to covenant curses.
* [
5:6
]
Basket
: literally, ephah, a dry measure; see note on
Is 5:10
.
* [
5:7
]
Woman sitting inside the basket
: figure representing wickedness or foreign idolatry being transported back to Babylonia (vv.
1
–
11
). Returning exiles were apparently worshiping deities they had learned to accept in Babylonia, and that “wickedness” (v.
8
) must be removed.
* [
5:9
]
Two women…wings
: composite beings, part human and part animal, similar to the cherubim flanking the holy ark (
Ex 25:18
–
22
;
1 Kgs 6:23
–
28
;
Ez 10:18
–
22
). Such creatures accompany foreign deities as here, or the biblical God.
* [
5:11
]
Shinar
: land of Babylonia; this name for Babylonia is found also in
Gn 1:10
;
11:2
;
14:1
;
Is 11:11
; and
Dn 1:2
.
