CHAPTER 24
The Sanctuary Light.
*
1
The L
ORD
said to Moses:
2
Order the Israelites to bring you clear oil of crushed olives for the light, so that you may keep the lamp burning regularly.
a
3
In the tent of meeting, outside the veil that hangs in front of the covenant, Aaron shall set up the lamp to burn before the L
ORD
regularly, from evening till morning, by a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
4
He shall set up the lamps on the pure gold menorah to burn regularly before the L
ORD
.
The Showbread.
*
5
You shall take bran flour and bake it into twelve cakes,
b
using two tenths of an ephah of flour for each cake.
6
These you shall place in two piles, six in each pile, on the pure gold table before the L
ORD
.
7
With each pile put some pure frankincense, which shall serve as an oblation to the L
ORD
, a token of the bread offering.
8
Regularly on each sabbath day the bread
c
shall be set out before the L
ORD
on behalf of the Israelites by an everlasting covenant.
9
It shall belong to Aaron and his sons, who must eat it in a sacred place, since it is most sacred,
d
his as a perpetual due from the oblations to the L
ORD
.
Punishment of Blasphemy.
*
10
A man born of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and in the camp a fight broke out between the son of the Israelite woman and an Israelite man.
11
The son of the Israelite woman uttered the L
ORD
’s name in a curse and blasphemed. So he was brought to Moses—now his mother’s name was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan—
12
and he was kept in custody till a decision from the L
ORD
should settle the case for them.
e
13
The L
ORD
then said to Moses:
14
Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and when all who heard him have laid their hands
*
on his head,
f
let the whole community stone him.
15
Tell the Israelites: Anyone who blasphemes God shall bear the penalty;
16
whoever utters the name of the L
ORD
in a curse shall be put to death.
g
The whole community shall stone that person; alien and native-born alike must be put to death for uttering the L
ORD
’s name in a curse.
17
*
Whoever takes the life of any human being shall be put to death;
h
18
whoever takes the life of an animal shall make restitution of another animal, life for a life.
i
19
*
Anyone who inflicts a permanent injury on his or her neighbor shall receive the same in return:
20
fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The same injury that one gives another shall be inflicted in return.
j
21
Whoever takes the life of an animal shall make restitution, but whoever takes a human life shall be put to death.
22
You shall have but one rule, for alien and native-born alike.
k
I, the L
ORD
, am your God.
23
When Moses told this to the Israelites, they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him;
l
they did just as the L
ORD
commanded Moses.

] On the lamp, see
Ex 25:31
–
40
;
26:35
;
27:20
–

;

;

–

. It occupies the south side of the anterior room of the sanctuary tent and provides light for that room.
* [
24:5
–
9
] On the bread table, see
Ex 25:23
–
29
;
26:35
;
37:10
–
16
;
40:22
–
23
. It occupies the north side of the anterior room of the sanctuary tent. The bread is a type of grain offering (see note on
2:1
).
* [
24:10
–
22
] This is a narrative where an offense leads to clarifying revelation similar to the cases in
Lv 10:1
–
7
and
16:1
–
34
;
Nm 9:6
–
14
and
15:32
–
36
.
* [
24:14
]
Laid their hands
: see notes on
1:4
and
16:21
. It may be that blasphemy generated a type of pollution which the hearers return to the culprit by this gesture.
* [
24:17
–
22
] A digression dealing with bodily injury follows the blasphemy rules. It may have been appended since the first case is another example of the death penalty. But the section develops according to its own logic. All legal traditions require death for homicide:
Gn 9:5
–
6
;
Ex 21:12
–
14
;
Nm 35:9
–
34
;
Dt 19:1
–
13
; cf.
Ex 20:13
and
Dt 5:17
.
* [
24:19
–
20
] The phrase “life for a life” in v.
18
leads to introducing the law of talion in vv.
19
–
20
. Some have interpreted the law here and the similar expressions in
Ex 21:23
–
25
and
Dt 19:21
to mean that monetary compensation equal to the injury is to be paid, though the wording of the law here and the context of
Dt 19:21
indicate an injury is to be inflicted upon the injurer.
