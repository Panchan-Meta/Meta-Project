PSALM 14
*
A Lament over Widespread Corruption
1
For the leader. Of David.
I
The fool says in his heart,
“There is no God.”
Their deeds are loathsome and corrupt;
not one does what is good.
a
2
The L
ORD
looks down from heaven
upon the children of men,
b
To see if even one is wise,
if even one seeks God.
c
3
All have gone astray;
all alike are perverse.
Not one does what is good,
not even one.
d
II
4
Will these evildoers never learn?
They devour my people as they devour bread;
e
they do not call upon the L
ORD
.
f
5
They have good reason, then, to fear;
God is with the company of the just.
6
They would crush the hopes of the poor,
but the poor have the L
ORD
as their refuge.
III
7
g
Oh, that from Zion might come
the salvation of Israel!
Jacob would rejoice, and Israel be glad
when the L
ORD
restores his people!

* [
Psalm 14
] The lament (duplicated in
Ps 53
) depicts the world as consisting of two types of people: “the fool” (equals the wicked,
Ps 14:1
–
3
) and “the company of the just” (
Ps 14:4
–
6
; also called “my people,” and “the poor”). The wicked persecute the just, but the Psalm expresses the hope that God will punish the wicked and reward the good.
* [
14:7
]
Jacobâ€¦Israelâ€¦his people
: the righteous poor are identified with God’s people.
