CHAPTER 50
Salvation Through the Lord’s Servant
1
Thus says the L
ORD
:
Where is the bill of divorce
with which I dismissed your mother?
*
Or to which of my creditors
have I sold you?
It was for your sins you were sold,
for your rebellions your mother was dismissed.
a
2
Why was no one there when I came?
Why did no one answer when I called?
*
Is my hand too short to ransom?
Have I not the strength to deliver?
See, with my rebuke I dry up the sea,
I turn rivers into wilderness;
Their fish rot for lack of water,
and die of thirst.
b
3
I clothe the heavens in black,
and make sackcloth their covering.
4
*
The Lord G
OD
has given me
a well-trained tongue,
That I might know how to answer the weary
a word that will waken them.
Morning after morning
he wakens my ear to hear as disciples do;
5
The Lord G
OD
opened my ear;
I did not refuse,
did not turn away.
*
6
I gave my back to those who beat me,
my cheeks to those who tore out my beard;
*
My face I did not hide
from insults and spitting.
c
7
The Lord G
OD
is my help,
therefore I am not disgraced;
Therefore I have set my face like flint,
knowing that I shall not be put to shame.
d
8
He who declares my innocence is near.
Who will oppose me?
Let us appear together.
Who will dispute my right?
Let them confront me.
9
See, the Lord G
OD
is my help;
who will declare me guilty?
See, they will all wear out like a garment,
consumed by moths.
e
10
Who among you fears the L
ORD
,
*
heeds his servant’s voice?
Whoever walk in darkness,
without any light,
Yet trust in the name of the L
ORD
and rely upon their God!
f
11
All you who kindle flames
and set flares alight,
Walk by the light of your own fire
and by the flares you have burnt!
This is your fate from my hand:
you shall lie down in a place of torment.
* [
50:1
] Responding to the people’s complaint of utter abandonment by God, the prophet asserts that their sins were responsible for their banishment. Since there was no bill of divorce, the bond between the Lord and his people still exists and he has the power to deliver them (v.
2
).
* [
50:2
] Israel’s faith in God is weak; the people do not answer God’s call, nor believe promises of deliverance.
* [
50:4
–
11
] The third of the four “servant of the Lord” oracles (cf. note on
42:1
–
4
); in vv.
4
–
9
the servant speaks; in vv.
10
–
11
God addresses the people directly.
* [
50:5
] The servant, like a well-trained disciple, does not refuse the divine vocation.
* [
50:6
] He willingly submits to insults and beatings.
Tore out my beard
: a grave and painful insult.
* [
50:10
–
11
] The Lord offers a choice to those who walk in darkness: either trust in the true light (v.
10
), or walk in their false light and suffer the consequences.
