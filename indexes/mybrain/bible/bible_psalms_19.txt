PSALM 19
*
God’s Glory in the Heavens and in the Law
1
For the leader. A psalm of David.
I
2
The heavens declare the glory of God;
the firmament proclaims the works of his hands.
a
3
Day unto day pours forth speech;
night unto night whispers knowledge.
4
*
There is no speech, no words;
their voice is not heard;
5
A report goes forth through all the earth,
their messages, to the ends of the world.
He has pitched in them a tent for the sun;
*
6
it comes forth like a bridegroom from his canopy,
and like a hero joyfully runs its course.
7
From one end of the heavens it comes forth;
its course runs through to the other;
nothing escapes its heat.
II
8
The law of the L
ORD
is perfect,
refreshing the soul.
The decree of the L
ORD
is trustworthy,
giving wisdom to the simple.
b
9
The precepts of the L
ORD
are right,
rejoicing the heart.
The command of the L
ORD
is clear,
enlightening the eye.
10
The fear of the L
ORD
is pure,
enduring forever.
The statutes of the L
ORD
are true,
all of them just;
11
More desirable than gold,
than a hoard of purest gold,
Sweeter also than honey
or drippings from the comb.
c
12
By them your servant is warned;
*
obeying them brings much reward.
III
13
Who can detect trespasses?
Cleanse me from my inadvertent sins.
14
Also from arrogant ones restrain your servant;
let them never control me.
Then shall I be blameless,
innocent of grave sin.
15
Let the words of my mouth be acceptable,
the thoughts of my heart before you,
L
ORD
, my rock and my redeemer.
* [
Psalm 19
] The heavenly elements of the world, now beautifully arranged, bespeak the power and wisdom of their creator (
Ps 19:2
–
7
). The creator’s wisdom is available to human beings in the law (
Ps 19:8
–
11
), toward which the psalmist prays to be open (
Ps 19:12
–
14
). The themes of light and speech unify the poem.
* [
19:4
]
No speech, no words
: the regular functioning of the heavens and the alternation of day and night inform human beings without words of the creator’s power and wisdom.
* [
19:5
]
The sun
: in other religious literature the sun is a judge and lawgiver since it sees all in its daily course;
Ps 19:5b
–
7
form a transition to the law in
Ps 19:8
–
11
. The six synonyms for God’s revelation (
Ps 19:8
–
11
) are applied to the sun in comparable literature.
* [
19:12
]
Warned
: the Hebrew verb means both to shine and to warn, cf.
Dn 12:3
.
a. [
19:2
]
Ps 8:1
;
50:6
;
97:6
.
b. [
19:8
]
Ps 12:7
;
119
.
c. [
19:11
]
Sir 24:19
.
