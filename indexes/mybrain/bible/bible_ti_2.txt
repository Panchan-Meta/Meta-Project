CHAPTER 2
Christian Behavior.
*
1
As for yourself, you must say what is consistent with sound doctrine, namely,
a
2
that older men should be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, love, and endurance.
3
Similarly, older women should be reverent in their behavior, not slanderers, not addicted to drink, teaching what is good,
4
so that they may train younger women to love their husbands and children,
5
to be self-controlled, chaste, good homemakers, under the control of their husbands, so that the word of God may not be discredited.
b
6
Urge the younger men, similarly, to control themselves,
7
showing yourself as a model of good deeds in every respect, with integrity in your teaching, dignity,
8
and sound speech that cannot be criticized, so that the opponent will be put to shame without anything bad to say about us.
9
Slaves are to be under the control of their masters in all respects, giving them satisfaction, not talking back to them
c
10
or stealing from them, but exhibiting complete good faith, so as to adorn the doctrine of God our savior in every way.
d
Transformation of Life.
11
*
For the grace of God has appeared, saving all
e
12
and training us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age,
13
as we await the blessed hope, the appearance
*
of the glory of the great God and of our savior Jesus Christ,
f
14
who gave himself for us to deliver us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people as his own, eager to do what is good.
g
15
Say these things. Exhort and correct with all authority. Let no one look down on you.

* [
2:1
–
10
] One of Titus’ main tasks in Crete is to become acquainted with the character of the Cretans and thereby learn to cope with its deficiencies (see
Ti 1:12
). The counsel is not only for Titus himself but for various classes of people with whom he must deal: older men and women (
Ti 2:2
–
4
), younger women and men (
Ti 2:4
–
7
), and slaves (
Ti 2:9
–
10
); cf.
Eph 6:1
–
9
;
Col 3:18
–
4:1
.
* [
2:11
–
15
] Underlying the admonitions for moral improvement in
Ti 2:1
–
10
as the moving force is the constant appeal to God’s revelation of salvation in Christ, with its demand for transformation of life.
* [
2:13

The blessed hope, the appearance
: literally, “the blessed hope and appearance,” but the use of a single article in Greek strongly suggests an epexegetical, i.e., explanatory sense.
Of the great God and of our savior Jesus Christ
: another possible translation is “of our great God and savior Jesus Christ.”
