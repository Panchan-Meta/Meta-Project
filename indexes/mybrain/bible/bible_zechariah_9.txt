CHAPTER 9
Restoration of the Land of Israel
*
1
An oracle:
*
the word of the L
ORD
is against the land of Hadrach,
and Damascus is its destination,
For the cities of Aram are the L
ORD
’s,
as are all the tribes of Israel.
2
Hamath also on its border,
Tyre too, and Sidon, no matter how clever they be.
3
Tyre built itself a stronghold,
and heaped up silver like dust,
and gold like the mud of the streets.
4
But now the Lord will dispossess it,
and cast its wealth into the sea,
and it will be devoured by fire.
5
Ashkelon will see it and be afraid;
Gaza too will be in great anguish;
Ekron also, for its hope will wither.
The king will disappear from Gaza,
Ashkelon will not be inhabited,
6
and the illegitimate will rule in Ashdod.
I will destroy the pride of the Philistines
7
and take from their mouths their bloody prey,
their disgusting meat from between their teeth.
They will become merely a remnant for our God,
a
and will be like a clan in Judah;
Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
*
8
I will encamp at my house,
a garrison against invaders;
No oppressor will overrun them again,
for now I have seen their affliction.
The King’s Entry into Jerusalem
*
9
Exult greatly, O daughter Zion!
Shout for joy, O daughter Jerusalem!
Behold: your king
*
is coming to you,
a just savior is he,
Humble, and riding on a donkey,
on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
b
10
He shall banish the chariot from Ephraim,
c
and the horse from Jerusalem;
The warrior’s bow will be banished,
and he will proclaim peace to the nations.
d
His dominion will be from sea to sea,
and from the River
*
to the ends of the earth.
e
Restoration of the People
11
As for you, by the blood of your covenant,
*
f
I have freed your prisoners from a waterless pit.
12
Return to a fortress,
*
O prisoners of hope;
This very day, I announce
I am restoring double to you.
13
For I have bent Judah as my bow,
I have set Ephraim as its arrow;
I will arouse your sons, O Zion,
against your sons, O Yavan,
*
and I will use you as a warrior’s sword.
14
The L
ORD
will appear over them,
God’s arrow will shoot forth as lightning;
The Lord G
OD
will sound the ram’s horn,
and come in a storm from the south.
g
15
The L
ORD
of hosts will protect them;
they will devour and conquer with sling stones,
they will drink and become heated as with wine;
they will be full like bowls—like the corners of the altar.
h
16
And the L
ORD
their God will save them:
the people, like a flock on that day;
i
For like gemstones of a crown
*
they will shine on the land.
17
Then how good and how lovely!
Grain will make the young men flourish,
and new wine the young women.

* [
9:1
–
8
] The opening verses of Second Zechariah delineate the ideal boundaries of a restored Israel. Echoing the ideas of Haggai and First Zechariah (chaps.
1
–
8
), the prophet reiterates the notion that the rebuilt Temple will bring about peace. The areas to be returned to Israel include Syria (Aram), with the cities of Hadrach and Damascus; Phoenicia, with the cities of Tyre and Sidon; and Philistia, with the cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and Ashdod.
* [
9:1
]
An oracle
: this designation also introduces
Zec 12:1
and
Mal 1:1
, suggesting a connection among the three units. The term functions as both a title to the larger literary unit (
Zec 9
–
11
) and a part of the message of the opening oracular statement.
* [
9:7
]
The Jebusites
: the pre-Israelite inhabitants of Jerusalem, conquered by David and incorporated into Israel.
* [
9:9
–
10
] These two verses form the centerpiece of chap.
9
. The restoration of a royal figure connects the first part of the chapter (vv.
1
–
8
), which depicts the restored land of Israel, with the second part (vv.
11
–
17
), which concerns the restoration of the people Israel.
* [
9:9
]
Your king
: a just savior, a figure of humble demeanor, but riding on a donkey like royalty in the ancient Near East (
Gn 49:11
;
Jgs 5:10
;
10:4
). The announcement of the coming of such a king marks a departure from the view of the royal figure as a conquering warrior. This depiction is in keeping with the tone of First Zechariah (
3:8
;
4:6
–
10
;
6:12
) but contrasts with Haggai (
2:20
–
23
). New Testament authors apply this prophecy to Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem (
Mt 21:4
–
5
;
Jn 12:14
–
15
).
* [
9:10
]
The River
: probably the Euphrates; see note on
Ps 72:8
.
* [
9:11
]
The blood of your covenant
: the covenant between the Lord and Israel sealed with sacrificial blood (
Ex 24:8
).
* [
9:12
]
Fortress
: the Hebrew word for “fortress” (
bissaron
) plays upon the Hebrew word for Zion (
siyyon
). Those who return to Zion will be protected by the Lord.
O prisoners of hope
: imagery of exile, conveying a sense that the future in Israel will be better.
* [
9:13
]
Your sons, O Yavan
: the reference is to the Greeks and their struggle with the Persians for control of Syria-Palestine and the eastern Mediterranean in the mid-fifth century B.C.
* [
9:16
]
Like gemstones of a crown
: imagery reminiscent of First Zechariah (
3:9
;
4:7
,
10
;
6:11
,
14
) and evocative of the Temple and the priestly headgear (cf.
Ex 29:6
and
Lv 8:9
).
