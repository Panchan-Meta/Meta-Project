PSALM 99
*
The Holy King
I
1
The L
ORD
is king, the peoples tremble;
he is enthroned on the cherubim,
*
the earth quakes.
a
2
Great is the L
ORD
in Zion,
exalted above all the peoples.
3
Let them praise your great and awesome name:
Holy is he!
b
II
4
O mighty king, lover of justice,
you have established fairness;
you have created just rule in Jacob.
c
5
Exalt the L
ORD
, our God;
bow down before his footstool;
*
d
holy is he!
III
6
Moses and Aaron were among his priests,
Samuel among those who called on his name;
they called on the L
ORD
, and he answered them.
e
7
From the pillar of cloud he spoke to them;
they kept his decrees, the law he had given them.
f
8
O L
ORD
, our God, you answered them;
you were a forgiving God to them,
though you punished their offenses.
g
9
Exalt the L
ORD
, our God;
bow down before his holy mountain;
holy is the L
ORD
, our God.

Psalm 99
] A hymn to God as the king whose grandeur is most clearly seen on Mount Zion (
Ps 99:2
) and in the laws given to Israel (
Ps 99:4
). Israel is special because of God’s word of justice, which was mediated by the revered speakers, Moses, Aaron, and Samuel (
Ps 99:6
–
8
). The poem is structured by the threefold statement that God is holy (
Ps 99:3
,
5
,
9
) and by the twice-repeated command to praise (
Ps 99:5
,
9
).
* [
99:1

Enthroned on the cherubim
