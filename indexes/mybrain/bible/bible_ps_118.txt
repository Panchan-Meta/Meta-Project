PSALM 118
*
Hymn of Thanksgiving
I
1
Give thanks to the L
ORD
, for he is good,
a
his mercy endures forever.
2
Let Israel say:
his mercy endures forever.
3
Let the house of Aaron say,
his mercy endures forever.
4
Let those who fear the L
ORD
say,
b
his mercy endures forever.
II
5
In danger I called on the L
ORD
;
the L
ORD
answered me and set me free.
6
The L
ORD
is with me; I am not afraid;
what can mortals do against me?
c
7
The L
ORD
is with me as my helper;
I shall look in triumph on my foes.
8
Better to take refuge in the L
ORD
d
than to put one’s trust in mortals.
9
Better to take refuge in the L
ORD
than to put one’s trust in princes.
III
10
All the nations surrounded me;
in the L
ORD
’s name I cut them off.
11
They surrounded me on every side;
in the L
ORD
’s name I cut them off.
12
They surrounded me like bees;
e
they burned up like fire among thorns;
in the L
ORD
’s name I cut them off.
13
I was hard pressed and falling,
but the L
ORD
came to my help.
f
14
The L
ORD
, my strength and might,
has become my savior.
g
IV
15
The joyful shout of deliverance
is heard in the tents of the righteous:
“The L
ORD
’s right hand works valiantly;
16
the L
ORD
’s right hand is raised;
the L
ORD
’s right hand works valiantly.”
17
I shall not die but live
and declare the deeds of the L
ORD
.
18
The L
ORD
chastised me harshly,
but did not hand me over to death.
V
19
Open the gates of righteousness;
I will enter and thank the L
ORD
.
h
20
This is the L
ORD
’s own gate,
through it the righteous enter.
21
I thank you for you answered me;
you have been my savior.
22
*
The stone the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone.
i
23
By the L
ORD
has this been done;
it is wonderful in our eyes.
24
This is the day the L
ORD
has made;
let us rejoice in it and be glad.
25
L
ORD
, grant salvation!
*
L
ORD
, grant good fortune!
VI
26
Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the L
ORD
.
j
We bless you from the house of the L
ORD
.
27
The L
ORD
is God and has enlightened us.
Join in procession with leafy branches
up to the horns of the altar.
VII
28
You are my God, I give you thanks;
my God, I offer you praise.
29
Give thanks to the L
ORD
, for he is good,
his mercy endures forever.
* [
Psalm 118
] A thanksgiving liturgy accompanying a procession of the king and the people into the Temple precincts. After an invocation in the form of a litany (
Ps 118:1
–
4
), the psalmist (very likely speaking in the name of the community) describes how the people confidently implored God’s help (
Ps 118:5
–
9
) when hostile peoples threatened its life (
Ps 118:10
–
14
); vividly God’s rescue is recounted (
Ps 118:15
–
18
). Then follows a possible dialogue at the Temple gates between the priests and the psalmist as the latter enters to offer the thanksgiving sacrifice (
Ps 118:19
–
25
). Finally, the priests impart their blessing (
Ps 118:26
–
27
), and the psalmist sings in gratitude (
Ps 118:28
–
29
).
* [
118:22
]
The stone the builders rejected
: a proverb: what is insignificant to human beings has become great through divine election. The “stone” may originally have meant the foundation stone or capstone of the Temple. The New Testament interpreted the verse as referring to the death and resurrection of Christ (
Mt 21:42
;
Acts 4:11
; cf.
Is 28:16
and
Rom 9:33
;
1 Pt 2:7
).
* [
118:25
]
Grant salvation
: the Hebrew for this cry has come into English as “Hosanna.” This cry and the words in
Ps 118:26
were used in the gospels to welcome Jesus entering the Temple on Palm Sunday (
Mk 11:9
–
10
).
