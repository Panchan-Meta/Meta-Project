CHAPTER 6
1
“Come, let us return to the L
ORD
,
a
For it is he who has torn, but he will heal us;
he has struck down, but he will bind our wounds.
2
He will revive us after two days;
on the third day
*
he will raise us up,
b
to live in his presence.
3
Let us know, let us strive to know the L
ORD
;
as certain as the dawn is his coming.
He will come to us like the rain,
like spring rain that waters the earth.”

4
What can I do with you, Ephraim?
What can I do with you, Judah?
Your loyalty is like morning mist,
like the dew that disappears early.
5
For this reason I struck them down through the prophets,
I killed them by the words of my mouth;
*
d
my judgment shines forth like the light.
6
For it is loyalty that I desire, not sacrifice,
and knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.

Further Crimes of Israel
7
But they, at Adam,
*
violated the covenant;
there they betrayed me.
8
Gilead
*
is a city of evildoers,
tracked with blood.
9
Like brigands lying in wait
is the band of priests.
They murder on the road to Shechem,
*
indeed they commit a monstrous crime.
10
In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing:
there is found Ephraim’s prostitution,
Israel is defiled.
11
For you also, Judah,
a harvest
*
has been appointed!
* [
6:2
]
After two days; on the third day
: presumptuous Israel expects that soon God will renew them (cf.
Ez 37
).
* [
6:5
] The word of God proclaimed by the prophets is effective, it accomplished what it promised: punishment.
* [
6:7
]
At Adam
: the violation of the covenant at Adam is mentioned nowhere else in the Bible. The place Adam, the location of which is unknown, may be referred to in
Jos 3:16
.
* [
6:8
]
Gilead
: city in Transjordan (
Gn 31:46
–
48
;
2 Kgs 15:25
).
* [
6:9
]
Shechem
: an important ancient religious and political center (
Jos 24
).
* [
6:11
]
Harvest
: God’s judgment, when Judah will reap what it has sown.
