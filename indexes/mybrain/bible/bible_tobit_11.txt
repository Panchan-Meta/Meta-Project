CHAPTER 11
Homeward Journey.
1
As they drew near to Kaserin, which is opposite Nineveh,
2
Raphael said: “You know how we left your father.
3
Let us hurry on ahead of your wife to prepare the house while they are still on the way.”
4
So both went on ahead together, and Raphael said to him, “Take the gall in your hand!” And the dog ran along behind them.
5
Meanwhile, Anna sat watching the road by which her son was to come.
6
When she saw him coming, she called to his father, “Look, your son is coming, and the man who traveled with him!”
7
Raphael said to Tobiah before he came near to his father: “I know that his eyes will be opened.
8
Apply the fish gall to his eyes, and the medicine will make the white scales shrink and peel off from his eyes; then your father will have sight again and will see the light of day.”
Sight Restored.
9
Then Anna ran up to her son, embraced him, and said to him, “Now that I have seen you again, son, I am ready to die!” And she sobbed aloud.

10
Tobit got up and stumbled out through the courtyard gate to meet his son. Tobiah went up to him
11
with the fish gall in his hand and blew into his eyes. Holding him firmly, he said, “Courage, father.” Then he applied the medicine to his eyes, and it made them sting.

Tobiah used both hands to peel the white scales from the corners of his eyes. Tobit saw his son and threw his arms around him.
14
Weeping, he exclaimed, “I can see you, son, the light of my eyes!” Then he prayed,
“Blessed be God,
blessed be his great name,
and blessed be all his holy angels.
May his great name be with us,
and blessed be all the angels throughout all the ages.
15
God it was who afflicted me,
and God who has had mercy on me.
Now I see my son Tobiah!”
Then Tobit went back in, rejoicing and praising God with full voice. Tobiah related to his father how his journey had been a success; that he had brought back the money; and that he had married Raguel’s daughter Sarah, who was about to arrive, for she was near the gate of Nineveh.

16
Rejoicing and blessing God, Tobit went out to the gate of Nineveh to meet his daughter-in-law. When the people of Nineveh saw him coming, walking along briskly, with no one leading him by the hand, they were amazed.
17
Before them all Tobit proclaimed how God had shown mercy to him and opened his eyes. When Tobit came up to Sarah, the wife of his son Tobiah, he blessed her and said: “Welcome, my daughter! Blessed be your God for bringing you to us, daughter! Blessed are your father and your mother. Blessed be my son Tobiah, and blessed be you, daughter! Welcome to your home with blessing and joy. Come in, daughter!” That day there was joy for all the Jews who lived in Nineveh.

Ahiqar and his nephew Nadin

were also on hand to rejoice with Tobit. Tobiah’s wedding feast was celebrated with joy for seven days, and many gifts were given to him.
