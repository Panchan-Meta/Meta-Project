CHAPTER 31
1
I made a covenant with my eyes
not to gaze upon a virgin.
2
What portion comes from God above,
what heritage from the Almighty on high?
3
Is it not calamity for the unrighteous,
and woe for evildoers?
4
Does he not see my ways,
and number all my steps?
a
5
If I have walked in falsehood
*
and my foot has hastened to deceit,
6
Let God weigh me in the scales of justice;
thus will he know my innocence!
b
7
If my steps have turned out of the way,
and my heart has followed my eyes,
or any stain clings to my hands,
8
Then may I sow, but another eat,
and may my produce be rooted up!
9
If my heart has been enticed toward a woman,
and I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door;
10
Then may my wife grind for another,
and may others kneel over her!
11
For that would be heinous,
a crime to be condemned,
c
12
A fire that would consume down to Abaddon
*
till it uprooted all my crops.
d
13
Had I refused justice to my manservant
or to my maidservant, when they had a complaint against me,
14
What then should I do when God rises up?
What could I answer when he demands an account?
15
Did not he who made me in the belly make him?
Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?
16
If I have denied anything that the poor desired,
e
or allowed the eyes of the widow to languish
17
While I ate my portion alone,
with no share in it for the fatherless,
18
Though like a father he
*
has reared me from my youth,
guiding me even from my mother’s womb—
19
If I have seen a wanderer without clothing,
or a poor man without covering,
20
Whose limbs have not blessed me
when warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
21
If I have raised my hand against the innocent
because I saw that I had supporters at the gate—
*
22
Then may my arm fall from the shoulder,
my forearm be broken at the elbow!
23
For I dread calamity from God,
and his majesty will overpower me.
24
Had I put my trust in gold
or called fine gold my security;
25
Or had I rejoiced that my wealth was great,
or that my hand had acquired abundance—
26
Had I looked upon the light
*
as it shone,
f
or the moon in the splendor of its progress,
27
And had my heart been secretly enticed
to blow them a kiss with my hand,
28
This too would be a crime for condemnation,
for I should have denied God above.
g
29
Had I rejoiced at the destruction of my enemy
or exulted when evil came upon him,
h
30
Even though I had not allowed my mouth to sin
by invoking a curse against his life—
31
Had not the men of my tent exclaimed,
“Who has not been filled with his meat!”
*
32
No stranger lodged in the street,
for I opened my door to wayfarers—
33
*
Had I, all too human, hidden my sins
and buried my guilt in my bosom
34
Because I feared the great multitude
and the scorn of the clans terrified me—
then I should have remained silent, and not come out of doors!
35
*
Oh, that I had one to hear my case:
here is my signature:
*
let the Almighty answer me!
Let my accuser write out his indictment!
i
36
Surely, I should wear it on my shoulder
*
or put it on me like a diadem;
37
Of all my steps I should give him an account;
like a prince
*
I should present myself before him.
38
If my land has cried out against me
till its furrows wept together;
39
If I have eaten its strength without payment
and grieved the hearts of its tenants;
40
Then let the thorns grow instead of wheat
and stinkweed instead of barley!
The words of Job are ended.
* [
31:5
–
34
] In a series of purificatory oaths, Job protests his innocence.
* [
31:12
]
Abaddon
: see note on
26:6
.
* [
31:18
]
He
: presumably God.
* [
31:21
]
Gate
: cf. notes on
5:4
;
Ru 4:1
.
* [
31:26
–
28
]
Light
: of the sun. Job never sinned by worshiping the sun or the moon.
Blow them a kiss
: an act of idolatrous worship.
* [
31:31
] The members of his extended family will testify to his hospitality.
* [
31:33
–
34
] Job’s present protest is made, not in spite of hidden sins which he had been unwilling to disclose, but out of genuine innocence.
All too human
: can also be translated “like Adam.”
* [
31:35
–
37
] This concluding bravado fits better after v.
40a
.
* [
31:35
]
My signature
: lit., “
tau
,” the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, shaped like a cross. Job issues a subpoena to God, and challenges him to follow proper legal procedure as well.
* [
31:36
]
On my shoulder
: i.e., boldly, proudly.
* [
31:37
]
Like a prince
: not as a frightened criminal.
