CHAPTER 7
1
a
Is not life on earth a drudgery,
*
its days like those of a hireling?
2
Like a slave who longs for the shade,
a hireling who waits for wages,
3
So I have been assigned months of futility,
and troubled nights have been counted off for me.
4
When I lie down I say, “When shall I arise?”
then the night drags on;
I am filled with restlessness until the dawn.
5
My flesh is clothed with worms and scabs;
b
my skin cracks and festers;
6
My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle;
they come to an end without hope.
7
Remember that my life is like the wind;
c
my eye will not see happiness again.
8
The eye that now sees me shall no more behold me;
when your eye is on me, I shall be gone.
9
As a cloud dissolves and vanishes,
d
so whoever goes down to Sheol shall not come up.
10
They shall not return home again;
their place shall know them no more.
11
My own utterance I will not restrain;
I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
12
*
Am I the Sea, or the dragon,
that you place a watch over me?
*
13
When I say, “My bed shall comfort me,
my couch shall ease my complaint,”
14
Then you frighten me with dreams
and terrify me with visions,
15
So that I should prefer strangulation
and death rather than my existence.
*
16
I waste away: I will not live forever;
e
let me alone, for my days are but a breath.
17
*
What are human beings, that you make much of them,
or pay them any heed?
18
You observe them every morning
f
and try them at every moment!
19
How long before you look away from me,
and let me alone till I swallow my spit?
20
If I sin, what do I do to you,
O watcher of mortals?
Why have you made me your target?
Why should I be a burden for you?
21
Why do you not pardon my offense,
or take away my guilt?
For soon I shall lie down in the dust;
and should you seek me I shall be gone.
