CHAPTER 26
Job’s Reply.
1
Then Job answered and said:
*
2
What help you give to the powerless,
what strength to the feeble arm!
3
How you give counsel to one without wisdom;
how profuse is the advice you offer!
4
With whose help have you uttered those words,
whose breath comes forth from you?
a
5
The shades
*
beneath writhe in terror,
b
the waters, and their inhabitants.
6
Naked before him is Sheol,
*
and Abaddon has no covering.
c
7
He stretches out Zaphon
*
over the void,
and suspends the earth over nothing at all;
8
He binds up the waters in his clouds,
yet the cloud is not split by their weight;
9
He holds back the appearance of the full moon
by spreading his clouds before it.
10
He has marked out a circle
*
on the surface of the deep
d
as the boundary of light and darkness.
11
The pillars of the heavens tremble
and are stunned at his thunderous rebuke;
e
12
By his power he stilled Sea,
by his skill he crushed Rahab;
*
13
By his wind the heavens were made clear,
his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
*
f
14
Lo, these are but the outlines of his ways,
and what a whisper of a word we hear of him:
Who can comprehend the thunder of his power?
