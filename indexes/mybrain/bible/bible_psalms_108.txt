PSALM 108
*
Prayer for Victory
1
A song; a psalm of David.
I
2
My heart is steadfast, God;
a
my heart is steadfast.
Let me sing and chant praise.
3
Awake, lyre and harp!
I will wake the dawn.
b
4
I will praise you among the peoples, L
ORD
;
I will chant your praise among the nations.
c
5
For your mercy is greater than the heavens;
your faithfulness, to the skies.
d
II
6
Appear on high over the heavens, God;
your glory above all the earth.
7
Help with your right hand and answer us
that your loved ones may escape.
8
God speaks in his holiness:
*
e
“I will exult, I will apportion Shechem;
the valley of Succoth I will measure out.
9
Gilead is mine, mine is Manasseh;
Ephraim is the helmet for my head,
Judah, my scepter.
10
Moab is my washbowl;
upon Edom I cast my sandal;
f
I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”
11
Who will bring me to the fortified city?
Who will lead me into Edom?
12
Was it not you who rejected us, God?
Do you no longer march with our armies?
g
13
Give us aid against the foe;
worthless is human help.
14
We will triumph with the help of God,
who will trample down our foes.

Psalm 108
] A prayer compiled from two other Psalms:
Ps 108:2
–
6
are virtually the same as
Ps 57:8
–
12
;
Ps 108:7
–
14
are the same as
Ps 60:7
–
14
. An old promise of salvation (
Ps 108:8
–
10
) is combined with a confident assurance (
Ps 108:2
–
6
,
13
) and petition (
Ps 108:7
,
12
–
13
).
* [

Holiness
: may also be translated as “sanctuary” or as referring to God’s heavenly abode.
