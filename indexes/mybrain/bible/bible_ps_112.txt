PSALM 112
*
The Blessings of the Just
1
Hallelujah!
Blessed the man who fears the L
ORD
,
who greatly delights in his commands.
a
2
His descendants shall be mighty in the land,
a generation of the upright will be blessed.
3
Wealth and riches shall be in his house;
his righteousness
*
shall endure forever.
4
Light shines through the darkness for the upright;
b
gracious, compassionate, and righteous.
5
It is good for the man gracious in lending,
who conducts his affairs with justice.
6
For he shall never be shaken;
the righteous shall be remembered forever.
c
7
He shall not fear an ill report;
his heart is steadfast, trusting the L
ORD
.
8
His heart is tranquil, without fear,
till at last he looks down on his foes.
9
Lavishly he gives to the poor;
his righteousness shall endure forever;
d
his horn
*
shall be exalted in honor.
10
The wicked sees and is angry;
gnashes his teeth and wastes away;
the desire of the wicked come to nothing.
* [
Psalm 112
] An acrostic poem detailing the blessings received by those who remain close to God by obedience to the commandments. Among their blessings are children (
Ps 112:2
), wealth that enables them to be magnanimous (
Ps 112:3
,
5
,
9
), and virtue by which they encourage others (
Ps 112:4
). The just person is an affront to the wicked, whose hopes remain unfulfilled (
Ps 112:10
). The logic resembles
Ps 1
;
111
.
* [
112:3
]
Righteousness
: in the Second Temple period the word acquired the nuance of liberality and almsgiving, cf.
Sir 3:30
;
7:10
;
Mt 6:1
–
4
.
* [
112:9
]
His horn
: the symbol for vitality and honor.
