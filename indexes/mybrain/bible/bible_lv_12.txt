CHAPTER 12
Uncleanness of Childbirth.
1
The L
ORD
said to Moses:
2
Tell the Israelites: When a woman has a child, giving birth to a boy, she shall be unclean
*
for seven days, with the same uncleanness as during her menstrual period.
a
3
On the eighth day, the flesh of the boy’s foreskin shall be circumcised,
*
b
4
and then she shall spend thirty-three days more in a state of blood purity; she shall not touch anything sacred nor enter the sanctuary till the days of her purification are fulfilled.
5
If she gives birth to a girl, for fourteen days she shall be as unclean as during her menstrual period, after which she shall spend sixty-six days
*
in a state of blood purity.
6
*
When the days of her purification for a son or for a daughter are fulfilled,
c
she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a yearling lamb for a burnt offering and a pigeon or a turtledove for a purification offering.
7
The priest shall offer them before the L
ORD
to make atonement for her, and thus she will be clean again after her flow of blood. Such is the ritual for the woman who gives birth to a child, male or female.
8
If, however, she cannot afford a lamb,
d
she may take two turtledoves or two pigeons,
e
the one for a burnt offering and the other for a purification offering. The priest shall make atonement for her, and thus she will again be clean.
* [
12:2
–
5
] The mother has two stages of uncleanness or impurity: the first where her uncleanness is as severe as during her menstrual period and is contagious to profane persons and objects (cf.
15:19
–
24
), and the second where she does not contaminate persons and objects but is still impure to what is holy, such as the sanctuary (
12:4
) or sacrifices. The implication is that in the second stage she may resume sexual relations with her husband (which would be prohibited in the first stage according to
18:19
).
* [
12:3
] Circumcision is the sign of the covenant between God and Israel (
Gn 17:1
–
27
) and allows full participation in the religious community (
Ex 12:43
–
49
;
Jos 5:2
–
10
). This command was fulfilled after Jesus’ birth (
Lk 2:21
).
* [
12:5
]
If she gives birth to a girl…sixty-six days
: while the longer period of uncleanness following the birth of a girl, compared to that following the birth of a boy, might reflect the relative disparity in social status between men and women in ancient Israel (and attested in other cultures), this is by no means certain. There is no simple correlation in the Bible between the worth of something and the degree of impurity it can occasion.
* [
12:6
–
8
] Certain tolerated impurities (see note on
11:1
–
15:33
) are strong enough to pollute the sanctuary and require purification offerings, including the parturient (see also
14:10
–
32
;
15:13
–
15
,
28
–
30
). Cf. note on
4:3
. Mary fulfilled the command of bringing sacrifices after the birth of Jesus (
Lk 2:22
–
24
).
