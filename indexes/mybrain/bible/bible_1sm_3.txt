CHAPTER 3
Revelation to Samuel.
1
During the time young Samuel was minister to the L
ORD
under Eli, the word of the L
ORD
was scarce and vision infrequent.
2
*
One day Eli was asleep in his usual place. His eyes had lately grown so weak that he could not see.
3
The lamp of God was not yet extinguished,
*
and Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the L
ORD
where the ark of God was.
a
4
The L
ORD
called to Samuel, who answered, “Here I am.”
5
He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am. You called me.” “I did not call you,” Eli answered. “Go back to sleep.” So he went back to sleep.
6
Again the L
ORD
called Samuel, who rose and went to Eli. “Here I am,” he said. “You called me.” But he answered, “I did not call you, my son. Go back to sleep.”
7
Samuel did not yet recognize the L
ORD
, since the word of the L
ORD
had not yet been revealed to him.
8
The L
ORD
called Samuel again, for the third time. Getting up and going to Eli, he said, “Here I am. You called me.” Then Eli understood that the L
ORD
was calling the youth.
9
So he said to Samuel, “Go to sleep, and if you are called, reply, ‘Speak, L
ORD
, for your servant is listening.’” When Samuel went to sleep in his place,
10
the L
ORD
came and stood there, calling out as before: Samuel, Samuel! Samuel answered, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”
11
The L
ORD
said to Samuel: I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears it ring.
b
12
On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I have said about his house, beginning to end.
13
I announce to him that I am condemning his house once and for all, because of this crime: though he knew his sons were blaspheming God, he did not reprove them.
c
14
Therefore, I swear to Eli’s house: No sacrifice or offering will ever expiate its crime.
*
15
Samuel then slept until morning, when he got up early and opened the doors of the temple of the L
ORD
. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,
16
but Eli called to him, “Samuel, my son!” He replied, “Here I am.”
17
Then Eli asked, “What did he say to you? Hide nothing from me! May God do thus to you, and more,
*
if you hide from me a single thing he told you.”
18
So Samuel told him everything, and held nothing back. Eli answered, “It is the L
ORD
. What is pleasing in the L
ORD
’s sight, the L
ORD
will do.”
Samuel Acknowledged as Prophet.
19
Samuel grew up, and the L
ORD
was with him, not permitting any word of his to go unfulfilled.
d
20
e
Thus all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba came to know that Samuel was a trustworthy prophet of the L
ORD
.
21
The L
ORD
continued to appear at Shiloh, manifesting himself to Samuel at Shiloh through his word.
Samuel’s word spread throughout Israel.

] The call of Samuel: This section may be divided as follows: 1. the triple summons (vv.
2
–
9
); 2. God’s revelation (vv.
10
–
14
); 3. Samuel informs Eli (vv.
15
–
18
).
* [
3:3
]
Not yet extinguished
: referring to the nighttime setting of this narrative (cf.
Ex 27:20
–
21
) and foreshadowing a permanently extinguished lamp when the ark is captured and Shiloh destroyed.
* [
3:14
]
Lv 4:3
–
12
presents another view: the offering of a bull can expiate priestly sin.
* [
3:17
]
May God do thus to you, and more
: an oath formula which strengthens Eli’s demand by threatening divine punishment if Samuel does not obey. Cf.
