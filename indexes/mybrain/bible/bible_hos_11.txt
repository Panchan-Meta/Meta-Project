CHAPTER 11
The Disappointment of a Parent
1
*
When Israel was a child I loved him,
a
out of Egypt
*
I called my son.
b
2
The more I called them,
the farther they went from me,
Sacrificing to the Baals
and burning incense to idols.
3
Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
who took them in my arms;
c
but they did not know that I cared for them.
4
I drew them with human cords,
with bands of love;
*
I fostered them like those
who raise an infant to their cheeks;
I bent down to feed them.
d
5
He shall return to the land of Egypt,
e
Assyria shall be his king,
because they have refused to repent.
6
The sword shall rage in his cities:
it shall destroy his diviners,
and devour them because of their schemings.
7
My people have their mind set on apostasy;
though they call on God in unison,
he shall not raise them up.
But Love Is Stronger and Restores
8
How could I give you up, Ephraim,
or deliver you up, Israel?
How could I treat you as Admah,
or make you like Zeboiim?
*
f
My heart is overwhelmed,
my pity is stirred.
9
I will not give vent to my blazing anger,
I will not destroy Ephraim again;
For I am God and not a man,
g
the Holy One present among you;
I will not come in wrath.
10
They shall follow the L
ORD
,
who roars like a lion;
h
When he roars,
his children shall come frightened from the west,
11
Out of Egypt they shall come trembling, like birds,
like doves, from the land of Assyria;
And I will resettle them in their homes,
oracle of the L
ORD
.

11:1
–
3
] After the image of husband-wife (chaps.
1
–
3
), Hosea uses the image of parent-child (
Ex 4:22
;
Is 1:2
;
Jer 3:19
).
* [
11:1
]
Out of Egypt
: Hosea dates the real beginning of Israel from the time of the exodus.
Mt 2:15
applies this text to the return of Jesus from Egypt.
* [
11:4
]
I drew them…with bands of love
: perhaps a reversal of the yoke imagery of the previous chapter, i.e., not forcing them like draft animals, but drawing them with kindness and affection.
* [
11:8
]
Admah…Zeboiim
: cities in the vicinity of Sodom and Gomorrah (
Gn 14:2
,
8
) and destroyed with them (
Gn 19:24
–
25
;
Dt 29:22
).
