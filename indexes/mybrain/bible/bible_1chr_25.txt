CHAPTER 25
The Singers.
1
David and the leaders of the liturgy set apart for the service the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, who prophesied
*
to the accompaniment of lyres and harps and cymbals.
a
This is the list of those who performed this service:
2
Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah, sons of Asaph, under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the guidance of the king.
3
Of Jeduthun, these sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah; six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied to the accompaniment of a lyre, to give thanks and praise to the L
ORD
.
4
Of Heman, these sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shubael, and Jerimoth; Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
5
All these were the sons of Heman, the king’s seer for divine matters; to exalt him God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
b
6
All these, whether of Asaph, Jeduthun, or Heman, were under their fathers’ direction in the singing in the house of the L
ORD
to the accompaniment of cymbals, harps and lyres, serving in the house of God, under the guidance of the king.
c
7
Their number, together with that of their kinsmen who were trained in singing to the L
ORD
, all of them skilled men, was two hundred and eighty-eight.
8
They cast lots for their functions equally, young and old, master and pupil alike.
d

* [
25:1
] This list of twenty-four classes of Temple singers balances the list of the twenty-four classes of priests (
24:4
–
19
). The last nine names in v.
4
, which seem to form a special group, were perhaps originally fragments or incipits (the opening words) of hymns. With some slight changes in the vocalization, these names would mean: “Have mercy on me, O L
ORD
,” “Have mercy on me,” “You are my God,” “I magnify,” “I extol the help of…,” “Sitting in adversity,” “I have fulfilled,” “He made abundant,” and “Visions.”
