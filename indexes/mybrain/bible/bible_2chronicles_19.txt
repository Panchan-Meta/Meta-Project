CHAPTER 19
Jehoshaphat Rebuked.
1
Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem.
2
Jehu the seer, son of Hanani,
*
went out to meet King Jehoshaphat and said to him: “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the L
ORD
? For this reason, wrath is upon you from the L
ORD
.
3
Yet some good has been found
*
in you, since you have removed the asherahs from the land and have set your heart to seek God.”
Judges Appointed.
4
Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem; but he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the highlands of Ephraim and brought them back to the L
ORD
, the God of their ancestors.
5
He appointed judges in the land, in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
6
and he said to them: “Take care what you do, for the judgment you give is not human but divine; for when it comes to judgment God will be with you.
a
7
And now, let the fear of the L
ORD
be upon you. Act carefully, for with the L
ORD
, our God, there is no injustice, no partiality, no bribe-taking.”
b
8
In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some Levites and priests and some of the family heads of Israel for the L
ORD
’s judgment and the disputes of those who dwell in Jerusalem.
c
9
He gave them this command: “Thus you shall act: in the fear of the L
ORD
, with fidelity and with an undivided heart.
10
And in every dispute that comes to you from your kin living in their cities, whether it concerns bloodguilt or questions of law, command, statutes, or ordinances, warn them lest they incur guilt before the L
ORD
and his wrath come upon you and your kin. Do that and you shall not incur guilt.
d
11
See now, Amariah is chief priest over you for everything that pertains to the L
ORD
, and Zebadiah, son of Ishmael, is leader of the house of Judah in all that pertains to the king; and the Levites will be your officials. Take firm action, and the L
ORD
will be with the good.”
