PSALM 40
*
Gratitude and Prayer for Help
1
For the leader. A psalm of David.
A
2
Surely, I wait for the L
ORD
;
who bends down to me and hears my cry,
a
3
Draws me up from the pit of destruction,
out of the muddy clay,
b
Sets my feet upon rock,
steadies my steps,
4
And puts a new song
*
in my mouth,
c
a hymn to our God.
Many shall look on in fear
and they shall trust in the L
ORD
.
5
Blessed the man who sets
his security in the L
ORD
,
who turns not to the arrogant
or to those who stray after falsehood.
d
6
You, yes you, O L
ORD
, my God,
have done many wondrous deeds!
And in your plans for us
there is none to equal you.
e
Should I wish to declare or tell them,
too many are they to recount.
f
7
*
Sacrifice and offering you do not want;
g
you opened my ears.
Holocaust and sin-offering you do not request;
8
so I said, “See; I come
with an inscribed scroll written upon me.
9
I delight to do your will, my God;
your law is in my inner being!”
h
10
When I sing of your righteousness
in a great assembly,
See, I do not restrain my lips;
as you, L
ORD
, know.
i
11
I do not conceal your righteousness
within my heart;
I speak of your loyalty and your salvation.
I do not hide your mercy or faithfulness from a great assembly.
12
L
ORD
, may you not withhold
your compassion from me;
May your mercy and your faithfulness
continually protect me.
j
B
13
But evils surround me
until they cannot be counted.
My sins overtake me,
so that I can no longer see.
They are more numerous than the hairs of my head;
my courage fails me.
k
14
L
ORD
, graciously rescue me!
l
Come quickly to help me, L
ORD
!
15
May those who seek to destroy my life
be shamed and confounded.
Turn back in disgrace
those who desire my ruin.
m
16
Let those who say to me “Aha!”
n
Be made desolate on account of their shame.
17
While those who seek you
rejoice and be glad in you.
May those who long for your salvation
always say, “The L
ORD
is great.”
o
18
Though I am afflicted and poor,
my Lord keeps me in mind.
You are my help and deliverer;
my God, do not delay!
* [
Psalm 40
] A thanksgiving (
Ps 40:2
–
13
) has been combined with a lament (
Ps 40:14
–
17
) that appears also in
Ps 70
. The psalmist describes the rescue in spatial terms—being raised up from the swampy underworld to firm earth where one can praise God (
Ps 40:2
–
4
). All who trust God will experience like protection (
Ps 40:5
–
6
)! The Psalm stipulates the precise mode of thanksgiving: not animal sacrifice but open and enthusiastic proclamation of the salvation just experienced (
Ps 40:7
–
11
). A prayer for protection concludes (
Ps 40:12
–
17
).
* [
40:4
]
A new song
: a song in response to the new action of God (cf.
Ps 33:3
;
96:1
;
144:9
;
149:1
;
Is 42:10
). Giving thanks is not purely a human response but is itself a divine gift.
* [
40:7
–
9
] Obedience is better than sacrifice (cf.
1 Sm 15:22
;
Is 1:10
–
20
;
Hos 6:6
;
Am 5:22
–
25
;
Mi 6:6
–
8
;
Acts 7:42
–
43
[quoting
Am 5:25
–
26
]).
Heb 10:5
–
9
quotes the somewhat different Greek version and interprets it as Christ’s self-oblation.
