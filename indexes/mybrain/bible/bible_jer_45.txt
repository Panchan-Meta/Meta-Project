CHAPTER 45
A Message to Baruch.
*
1
The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, son of Neriah, when he wrote on a scroll words from Jeremiah’s own mouth in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah:
a
2
Thus says the L
ORD
, God of Israel, to you, Baruch.
3
You said, “Woe is me! the L
ORD
has added grief to my pain.
b
I have worn myself out with groaning; rest eludes me.”
4
You must say this to him. Thus says the L
ORD
: What I have built, I am tearing down; what I have planted, I am uprooting: all this land.
c
5
And you, do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them! I am bringing evil on all flesh—oracle of the L
ORD
—but I will grant you your life as spoils of war, wherever you may go.

] At the conclusion of his narrative, Baruch appends a message Jeremiah had given him when he first wrote down Jeremiah’s words (cf.
36:4
). The future revealed by the prophet overwhelmed Baruch; now he learns his own safety is assured, even though the Lord will destroy Judah.
