CHAPTER 47
Against the Philistines.
1
The word of the L
ORD
that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh attacked Gaza:
a
2
Thus says the L
ORD
:
*
See: waters are rising from the north,
to become a torrent in flood;
They shall flood the land and all it contains,
the cities and their inhabitants.
People will howl and wail,
every inhabitant of the land.
3
At the noise of the pounding hooves of his steeds,
the clanking chariots, the rumbling wheels,
Parents do not turn back for their children;
their hands hang helpless,
4
Because of the day that is coming
to destroy all the Philistines
And cut off from Tyre and Sidon
*
the last of their allies.
Yes, the L
ORD
is destroying the Philistines,
the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.
b
5
Baldness is visited upon Gaza,
c
Ashkelon is reduced to silence;
Ashdod, remnant of their strength,
how long will you gash yourself?
*
6
Ah! Sword of the L
ORD
!
When will you find rest?
Return to your scabbard;
stop, be still!
7
How can it find rest
when the L
ORD
has commanded it?
Against Ashkelon and the seacoast,
there he has appointed it.
d
* [
47:2
–
7
] Nebuchadnezzar’s military campaign against Ashkelon in 604 B.C. may provide some historical background for this poem.
* [
47:4
]
Tyre and Sidon
: Phoenician seaports allied commercially with the Philistines and often rebelling against Nebuchadnezzar; cf.
27:1
–
4
. After the capture of Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar carried out a partially successful thirteen-year siege of Tyre.
Caphtor
: Crete and other Aegean islands, points of origin for the Philistines and other sea peoples; cf.
Am 9:7
.
* [
47:5
]
Baldness…gash yourself
: close-cropped hair, silence, and ritual slashing of the body express mourning and grief and here represent the mourner’s awareness that chaos has overcome order (cf.
41:5
).
