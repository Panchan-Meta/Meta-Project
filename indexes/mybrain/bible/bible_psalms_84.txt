PSALM 84
*
Prayer of a Pilgrim to Jerusalem
1
For the leader; “upon the
gittith
.” A psalm of the Korahites.
I
2
How lovely your dwelling,
O L
ORD
of hosts!
a
3
My soul yearns and pines
for the courts of the L
ORD
.
b
My heart and flesh cry out
for the living God.
4
*
As the sparrow finds a home
and the swallow a nest to settle her young,
My home is by your altars,
L
ORD
of hosts, my king and my God!
c
5
Blessed are those who dwell in your house!
They never cease to praise you.
Selah
II
6
Blessed the man who finds refuge in you,
in their hearts are pilgrim roads.
7
As they pass through the Baca valley,
*
they find spring water to drink.
The early rain covers it with blessings.
8
They will go from strength to strength
*
and see the God of gods on Zion.
III
9
L
ORD
God of hosts, hear my prayer;
listen, God of Jacob.
Selah
10
*
O God, watch over our shield;
look upon the face of your anointed.
d
IV
11
Better one day in your courts
than a thousand elsewhere.
Better the threshold of the house of my God
than a home in the tents of the wicked.
12
For a sun and shield is the L
ORD
God,
bestowing all grace and glory.
The L
ORD
withholds no good thing
from those who walk without reproach.
13
O L
ORD
of hosts,
blessed the man who trusts in you!

, where the image for the desire of the pilgrim is the thirst of the deer for water.
* [

Strength to strength
: pass through outer and inner wall.
