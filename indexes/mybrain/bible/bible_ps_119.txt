Aleph
1
Blessed those whose way is blameless,
who walk by the law of the L

who seek him with all their heart.
b
3
They do no wrong;
they walk in his ways.
4
You have given them the command
to observe your precepts with care.
5
May my ways be firm
in the observance of your statutes!
6
Then I will not be ashamed
to ponder all your commandments.
7
I will praise you with sincere heart
as I study your righteous judgments.
8
I will observe your statutes;
do not leave me all alone.
Beth
9
How can the young keep his way without fault?
Only by observing your words.

With all my heart I seek you;
do not let me stray from your commandments.
11
In my heart I treasure your promise,
that I may not sin against you.
12
Blessed are you, O L
ORD
;
teach me your statutes.
c
13
With my lips I recite
all the judgments you have spoken.
14
I find joy in the way of your testimonies
more than in all riches.
15
I will ponder your precepts
and consider your paths.
16
In your statutes I take delight;
I will never forget your word.
Gimel
17
Be kind to your servant that I may live,
that I may keep your word.
18
Open my eyes to see clearly
the wonders of your law.
19
I am a sojourner in the land;
*
d
do not hide your commandments from me.
20
At all times my soul is stirred
with longing for your judgments.
21
With a curse you rebuke the proud
who stray from your commandments.
22
Free me from disgrace and contempt,
for I keep your testimonies.
23
Though princes meet and talk against me,
your servant meditates on your statutes.
24
Your testimonies are my delight;
they are my counselors.
Daleth
25
My soul clings to the dust;
e
give me life in accord with your word.
26
I disclosed my ways and you answered me;
teach me your statutes.
27
Make me understand the way of your precepts;
I will ponder your wondrous deeds.
28
My soul is depressed;
lift me up according to your word.
29
Lead me from the way of deceit;
favor me with your law.
30
The way of loyalty I have chosen;
I have kept your judgments.
31
I cling to your testimonies, L
ORD
;
do not let me come to shame.
32
I will run the way of your commandments,
for you will broaden my heart.
He

L
ORD

I shall keep them with care.

Give me understanding to keep your law,
to observe it with all my heart.
35
Lead me in the path of your commandments,
g
for that is my delight.
36
Direct my heart toward your testimonies
and away from gain.
37
Avert my eyes from what is worthless;
by your way give me life.

For your servant, fulfill your promise
made to those who fear you.

Turn away from me the taunts I dread,

because I cherish your precepts.

without fear even before kings.

*
I lift up my hands to your commandments;
I study your statutes, which I love.
Zayin
49
Remember your word to your servant
by which you give me hope.
50
This is my comfort in affliction,
your promise that gives me life.
51
Though the arrogant utterly scorn me,
I do not turn from your law.
52
When I recite your judgments of old
I am comforted, L
ORD
.
53
Rage seizes me because of the wicked;
they forsake your law.
54
Your statutes become my songs
wherever I make my home.
55
Even at night I remember your name
in observance of your law, L
ORD
.
56
This is my good fortune,
for I have kept your precepts.
Heth
57
My portion is the L
ORD

I entreat you with all my heart:
have mercy on me in accord with your promise.
59
I have examined my ways
and turned my steps to your testimonies.
60
I am prompt, I do not hesitate
in observing your commandments.
61
Though the snares of the wicked surround me,
your law I do not forget.
62
At midnight I rise to praise you
because of your righteous judgments.
63
I am the friend of all who fear you,
of all who observe your precepts.
64
The earth, L
ORD
, is filled with your mercy;
h
teach me your statutes.
Teth
65
You have treated your servant well,
according to your word, O L
ORD
.

Teach me wisdom and knowledge,
for in your commandments I trust.
67
Before I was afflicted I went astray,
but now I hold to your promise.
68
You are good and do what is good;
teach me your statutes.
69
The arrogant smear me with lies,
but I keep your precepts with all my heart.
70
Their hearts are gross and fat;
i
as for me, your law is my delight.
71
It was good for me to be afflicted,
in order to learn your statutes.
72
The law of your mouth is more precious to me
than heaps of silver and gold.
Yodh
73
Your hands made me and fashioned me;
give me understanding to learn your commandments.
74
Those who fear you rejoice to see me,
because I hope in your word.
75
I know, L
ORD
, that your judgments are righteous;
though you afflict me, you are faithful.
76
May your mercy comfort me
in accord with your promise to your servant.
77
Show me compassion that I may live,
for your law is my delight.
78
Shame the proud for leading me astray with falsehood,
that I may study your testimonies.

that I may not be put to shame.

I am like a wineskin shriveled by smoke,
l
but I have not forgotten your statutes.

How long can your servant survive?
When will your judgment doom my foes?
85
The arrogant have dug pits for me;
defying your law.
86
All your commandments are steadfast.
Help me! I am pursued without cause.
87
They have almost put an end to me on earth,
but I do not forsake your precepts.
88
In your mercy give me life,
to observe the testimonies of your mouth.
Lamedh

Your word, L
ORD
, stands forever;
m
it is firm as the heavens.
90
Through all generations your truth endures;
fixed to stand firm like the earth.
91
By your judgments they stand firm to this day,
for all things are your servants.

Had your law not been my delight,
I would have perished in my affliction.
93
I will never forget your precepts;
through them you give me life.
94
I am yours; save me,
for I cherish your precepts.

How sweet to my tongue is your promise,
sweeter than honey to my mouth!
o
104
Through your precepts I gain understanding;
therefore I hate all false ways.
Nun

Your word is a lamp for my feet,
a light for my path.

I make a solemn vow
to observe your righteous judgments.

I am very much afflicted, L
ORD
;
give me life in accord with your word.

Accept my freely offered praise;
q
L
ORD

109
My life is always at risk,
but I do not forget your law.

* [
Psalm 119
] This Psalm, the longest by far in the Psalter, praises God for giving such splendid laws and instruction for people to live by. The author glorifies and thanks God for the Torah, prays for protection from sinners enraged by others’ fidelity to the law, laments the cost of obedience, delights in the law’s consolations, begs for wisdom to understand the precepts, and asks for the rewards of keeping them. Several expected elements do not appear in the Psalm: Mount Sinai with its story of God’s revelation and gift to Israel of instruction and commandments, the Temple and other institutions related to revelation and laws (frequent in other Psalms). The Psalm is fascinated with God’s word directing and guiding human life. The poem is an acrostic; its twenty-two stanzas (of eight verses each) are in the order of the Hebrew alphabet. Each of the eight verses within a stanza begins with the same letter. Each verse contains one word for “instruction.” The translation here given attempts to translate each Hebrew word for “instruction” with the same English word. There are, however, nine words for “instruction,” not eight, so the principle of a different word for “instruction” in each verse cannot be maintained with perfect consistency. The nine words for “instruction” in the translation are: law, statute, commandment, precept, testimony, word, judgment, way, and promise.

A sojourner in the land
: like someone without the legal protection of a native inhabitant, the psalmist has a special need for the guidance of God’s teaching.
* [
119:48
]
I lift up my hands to your commandments
: to lift up the hands was an ancient gesture of reverence to God. Here the picture is applied to God’s law.
* [

] God’s word creates the world, which manifests that word by its permanence and reliability.
