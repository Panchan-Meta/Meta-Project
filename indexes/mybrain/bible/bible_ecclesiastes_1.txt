CHAPTER 1
1
The words of David’s son, Qoheleth, king in Jerusalem:
*
a
2
Vanity of vanities,
*
says Qoheleth,
vanity of vanities! All things are vanity!
b
Vanity of Human Toil
3
What profit have we from all the toil
which we toil at under the sun?
*
c
4
One generation departs and another generation comes,
but the world forever stays.
5
The sun rises and the sun sets;
then it presses on to the place where it rises.
6
Shifting south, then north,
back and forth shifts the wind, constantly shifting its course.
7
All rivers flow to the sea,
yet never does the sea become full.
To the place where they flow,
the rivers continue to flow.
8
All things are wearisome,
*
too wearisome for words.
The eye is not satisfied by seeing
nor has the ear enough of hearing.
d
9
What has been, that will be; what has been done, that will be done. Nothing is new under the sun!
e
10
Even the thing of which we say, “See, this is new!” has already existed in the ages that preceded us.
f
11
There is no remembrance of past generations;
g
nor will future generations be remembered by those who come after them.

I. QOHELETH’S INVESTIGATION OF LIFE
Twofold Introduction.
12
I, Qoheleth, was king over Israel in Jerusalem,
13
and I applied my mind to search and investigate in wisdom all things that are done under the sun.
h
A bad business God has given
to human beings to be busied with.
14
I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a chase after wind.
*
i
15
What is crooked cannot be made straight,
and you cannot count what is not there.
*
16
j
Though I said to myself, “See, I have greatly increased my wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem, and my mind has broad experience of wisdom and knowledge,”
17
yet when I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly, I learned that this also is a chase after wind.
k
18
For in much wisdom there is much sorrow;
whoever increases knowledge increases grief.

* [
1:1
]
David’s son…king in Jerusalem
: the intent of the author is to identify himself with Solomon. This is a literary device, by which the author hopes to commend his work to the public under the name of Israel’s most famous sage (see
1 Kgs 5:9
–
14
).
* [
1:2
]
Vanity of vanities
: a Hebrew superlative expressing the supreme degree of futility and emptiness.
* [
1:3
]
Under the sun
: used throughout this book to signify “on the earth.”
* [
1:8
]
All things are wearisome
: or, “All speech is wearisome.”
* [
1:11
] Movement in nature and human activity appears to result in change and progress. The author argues that this change and progress are an illusion: “Nothing is new under the sun.”
* [
1:14
]
A chase after wind
: an image of futile activity, like an attempt to corral the winds; cf.
Hos 12:2
. The ancient versions understood “affliction, dissipation of the spirit.” This phrase concludes sections of the text as far as
6:9
.
* [
1:15
]
You cannot count what is not there
: perhaps originally a commercial metaphor alluding to loss or deficit in the accounts ledger.
* [
1:18
]
Sorrow…grief
: these terms refer not just to a store of knowledge or to psychological or emotional pain. Corporal punishment, sometimes quite harsh, was also employed frequently by parents and teachers.
