CHAPTER 14
1
Samaria
*
has become guilty,
for she has rebelled against her God.
They shall fall by the sword,
their infants shall be dashed to pieces,
a
their pregnant women shall be ripped open.
b
Sincere Conversion and New Life
2
Return, Israel, to the L
ORD
, your God;
you have stumbled because of your iniquity.
3
Take with you words,
and return to the L
ORD
;
Say to him, “Forgive all iniquity,
and take what is good.
Let us offer the fruit of our lips.
c
4
*
Assyria will not save us,
nor will we mount horses;
d
We will never again say, ‘Our god,’
to the work of our hands;
for in you the orphan finds compassion.”
e
5
I will heal their apostasy,
I will love them freely;
for my anger is turned away from them.
6
I will be like the dew for Israel:
f
he will blossom like the lily;
He will strike root like the Lebanon cedar,
7
and his shoots will go forth.
g
His splendor will be like the olive tree
and his fragrance like Lebanon cedar.
h
8
Again they will live in his shade;
they will raise grain,
They will blossom like the vine,
and his renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.
9
Ephraim! What more have I to do with idols?
i
I have humbled him, but I will take note of him.
I am like a verdant cypress tree.
*
From me fruit will be found for you!
Epilogue
10
*
Who is wise enough to understand these things?
j
Who is intelligent enough to know them?
Straight are the paths of the L
ORD
,
k
the just walk in them,
l
but sinners stumble in them.
* [
14:1
]
Samaria
: the capital of the Northern Kingdom will fall; this is the punishment predicted for Ephraim, the Northern Kingdom.
* [
14:4
] These good intentions promise a reversal of Israel’s sins: no more reliance on “Assyria,” i.e., on foreign alliances (see notes on
8:9
and
12:2
), on “horses,” i.e., on human power (
10:13
), and on idolatry (
8:4
–
6
;
13:2
). Israel will trust in the Lord alone.
* [
14:9
]
Verdant cypress tree
: the symbol of lasting life, the opposite of the sacred trees of the Baal cult (
4:13
). The Lord provides the “fruit” (
peri
) to Israel (
2:7
,
10
), another instance of the wordplay on Ephraim (see notes on
9:16
and
13:15
).
