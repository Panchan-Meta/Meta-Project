Jerusalem, take off your robe of mourning and misery;
put on forever the splendor of glory from God:

Wrapped in the mantle of justice from God,
place on your head the diadem
of the glory of the Eternal One.

For God will show your splendor to all under the heavens;
4
you will be named by God forever:
the peace of justice, the glory of God’s worship.
c
5
Rise up, Jerusalem! stand upon the heights;
look to the east and see your children
Gathered from east to west
at the word of the Holy One,
rejoicing that they are remembered by God.
6
Led away on foot by their enemies they left you:
but God will bring them back to you
carried high in glory as on royal thrones.

For God has commanded
that every lofty mountain
and the age-old hills be made low,
That the valleys be filled to make level ground,
that Israel may advance securely in the glory of God.
e
8
The forests and every kind of fragrant tree
have overshadowed Israel at God’s command;
f
9
For God is leading Israel in joy
by the light of his glory,
with the mercy and justice that are his.
