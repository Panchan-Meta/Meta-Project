CHAPTER 60
The Dawning of Divine Glory for Zion
1
*
Arise! Shine, for your light has come,
the glory of the L
ORD
has dawned upon you.
a
2
Though darkness covers the earth,
and thick clouds, the peoples,
Upon you the L
ORD
will dawn,
and over you his glory will be seen.
3
Nations shall walk by your light,
kings by the radiance of your dawning.
b
The Nations Come to Zion
4
Raise your eyes and look about;
they all gather and come to you—
Your sons from afar,
your daughters in the arms of their nurses.
c
5
Then you shall see and be radiant,
your heart shall throb and overflow.
For the riches of the sea shall be poured out before you,
the wealth of nations shall come to you.
6
Caravans of camels shall cover you,
dromedaries of Midian and Ephah;
All from Sheba shall come
bearing gold and frankincense,
and heralding the praises of the L
ORD
.
7
All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered for you,
the rams of Nebaioth shall serve your needs;
They will be acceptable offerings on my altar,
and I will glorify my glorious house.
8
Who are these that fly along like a cloud,
like doves to their cotes?
9
The vessels of the coastlands are gathering,
with the ships of Tarshish in the lead,
To bring your children from afar,
their silver and gold with them—
For the name of the L
ORD
, your God,
for the Holy One of Israel who has glorified you.
Honor and Service for Zion
*
10
Foreigners shall rebuild your walls,
their kings shall minister to you;
Though in my wrath I struck you,
yet in my good will I have shown you mercy.
d
11
Your gates shall stand open constantly;
day and night they shall not be closed
So that they may bring you the wealth of nations,
with their kings in the vanguard.
e
12
For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you shall perish;
such nations shall be utterly destroyed!
f
13
The glory of Lebanon shall come to you—
the juniper, the fir, and the cypress all together—
To bring beauty to my sanctuary,
and glory to the place where I stand.
g
14
The children of your oppressors shall come,
bowing before you;
All those who despised you,
shall bow low at your feet.
They shall call you “City of the L
ORD
,”
“Zion of the Holy One of Israel.”
15
No longer forsaken and hated,
with no one passing through,
Now I will make you the pride of the ages,
a joy from generation to generation.
16
You shall suck the milk of nations,
and be nursed at royal breasts;
And you shall know that I, the L
ORD
, am your savior,
your redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
17
Instead of bronze I will bring gold,
instead of iron I will bring silver;
Instead of wood, bronze;
instead of stones, iron.
I will appoint peace your governor,
and justice your ruler.
h
18
No longer shall violence be heard of in your land,
or plunder and ruin within your borders.
You shall call your walls “Salvation”
and your gates “Praise.”
Eternal Light for Zion
19
*
No longer shall the sun
be your light by day,
Nor shall the brightness of the moon
give you light by night;
Rather, the L
ORD
will be your light forever,
your God will be your glory.
i
20
No longer will your sun set,
or your moon wane;
For the L
ORD
will be your light forever,
and the days of your grieving will be over.
21
Your people will all be just;
for all time they will possess the land;
They are the shoot that I planted,
the work of my hands, that I might be glorified.
j
22
The least one shall become a clan,
the smallest, a mighty nation;
I, the L
ORD
, will swiftly accomplish
these things when the time comes.

* [
60:1
–
9
] The light the prophet proclaims to Zion symbolizes the blessing to come to her: the glory of the Lord, the return of her children, the wealth of nations who themselves will walk by her light. The passage is famous from its use in the Latin liturgy for the feast of Epiphany.
* [
60:10
–
18
] The glorious promises for the future continue: the wealth of the nations (vv.
5
,
10
), tribute from kings, glorification of the Temple, peace and justice (cf.
Ps 85:11
).
* [
60:19
–
20
] The theme of light is taken up again, but in an apocalyptic vein: the Lord’s radiant presence replaces physical light.
