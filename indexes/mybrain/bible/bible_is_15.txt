CHAPTER 15
Moab
*
1
Oracle on Moab:
Laid waste in a night,
Ar of Moab is destroyed;
Laid waste in a night,
Kir of Moab is destroyed.
2
Daughter Dibon has gone up
to the high places to weep;
Over Nebo and over Medeba
Moab is wailing.
Every head is shaved,
every beard sheared off.
*
a
3
In the streets they wear sackcloth,
and on the rooftops;
In the squares
everyone wails, streaming with tears.
b
4
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,
they are heard as far as Jahaz.
At this the loins of Moab tremble,
his soul quivers within him;
c
5
My heart cries out for Moab,
his fugitives reach Zoar,
Eglath-shelishiyah:
The ascent of Luhith
they ascend weeping;
On the way to Horonaim
they utter rending cries;
d
6
The waters of Nimrim
have become a waste,
The grass is withered,
new growth is gone,
nothing is green.
7
So now whatever they have acquired or stored away
they carry across the Wadi of the Poplars.
8
The cry has gone round
the territory of Moab;
As far as Eglaim his wailing,
even at Beer-elim his wailing.
9
*
The waters of Dimon are filled with blood,
but I will bring still more upon Dimon:
Lions for those who are fleeing from Moab
and for those who remain in the land!
* [
15:1
–
16:14
] Both the historical situation reflected in this oracle against Moab and the date of composition are uncertain. Variants of the same poem are found in
Jer 48
, and there are connections with
Nm 21:27
–
30
as well.
* [
15:2
]
Shaved…sheared off
: traditional signs of grief.
* [
15:9
] There is a play on words between “Dimon” and
dam
, the Hebrew word for blood.
