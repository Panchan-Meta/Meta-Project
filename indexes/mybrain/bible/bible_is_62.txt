CHAPTER 62
A New Name for Zion
1
*
For Zion’s sake I will not be silent,
for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep still,
Until her vindication shines forth like the dawn
and her salvation like a burning torch.
a
2
Nations shall behold your vindication,
and all kings your glory;
You shall be called by a new name
bestowed by the mouth of the L
ORD
.
b
3
You shall be a glorious crown in the hand of the L
ORD
,
a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
4
No more shall you be called “Forsaken,”
nor your land called “Desolate,”
But you shall be called “My Delight is in her,”
and your land “Espoused.”
For the L
ORD
delights in you,
and your land shall be espoused.
c
5
For as a young man marries a virgin,
your Builder shall marry you;
And as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride
so shall your God rejoice in you.
6
Upon your walls, Jerusalem,
I have stationed sentinels;
By day and by night,
they shall never be silent.
You who are to remind the L
ORD
,
take no rest,
7
And give him no rest,
until he re-establishes Jerusalem
And makes it the praise of the earth.
The Blessings of Salvation for God’s People
8
*
The L
ORD
has sworn by his right hand
and by his mighty arm:
No more will I give your grain
as food to your enemies;
Nor shall foreigners drink the wine,
for which you toiled.
d
9
But those who harvest shall eat,
and praise the L
ORD
;
Those who gather shall drink
in my holy courts.
e
10
*
Pass through, pass through the gates,
prepare a way for the people;
f
Build up, build up the highway, clear it of stones,
raise up a standard over the nations.
11
The L
ORD
has proclaimed
to the ends of the earth:
Say to daughter Zion,
“See, your savior comes!
See, his reward is with him,
his recompense before him.”
g
12
They shall be called “The Holy People,”
“The Redeemed of the L
ORD
.”
And you shall be called “Cared For,”
“A City Not Forsaken.”

, the prophet addresses Zion, announcing the reversal of her fortune. Several motifs reappear: light and glory (

,

–

), tribute of nations (

), and especially the marriage (
61:10
; cf. also

).
* [

–

] Peace and prosperity are indicated by the absence of invaders who would live off the land.

] The gates of Babylon are to be opened for the exiles to return, led by the Lord, as in
