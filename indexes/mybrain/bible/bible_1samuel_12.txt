CHAPTER 12
*
Samuel’s Integrity.
1
*
Samuel addressed all Israel: “I have granted your request in every respect,” he said. “I have set a king over you
a
2
and now the king will lead you. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are among you. I was your leader from my youth to the present day.
3
Here I stand! Answer me in the presence of the L
ORD
and the L
ORD
’s anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I wronged? From whom have I accepted a bribe and shut my eyes because of it? I will make restitution to you.”
b
4
They replied, “You have neither cheated us, nor oppressed us, nor accepted anything from anyone.”
5
So he said to them, “The L
ORD
is witness against you this day, and the L
ORD
’s anointed is witness, that you have found nothing in my possession.” “The L
ORD
is witness,” they said.
Samuel Admonishes the People.
6
Samuel continued: “The L
ORD
is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt.
c
7
Now take your stand, that I may judge you in the presence of the L
ORD
according to all the gracious acts that the L
ORD
has done for you and your ancestors.
8
When Jacob and his sons went to Egypt and the Egyptians oppressed them, your ancestors cried out to the L
ORD
. The L
ORD
then sent Moses and Aaron to bring them out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
d
9
But they forgot the L
ORD
their God; and so the L
ORD
sold them into the power of Sisera, the captain of the army of Hazor, the power of the Philistines, and the power of the king of Moab, who made war against them.
e
10
They cried out to the L
ORD
and said, ‘We have sinned because we abandoned the L
ORD
and served the Baals and Astartes. Now deliver us from the power of our enemies, and we will serve you.’
f
11
The L
ORD
sent Jerubbaal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel; he delivered you from the power of your enemies on every side, so that you could live in security.
g
12
Yet, when you saw Nahash, king of the Ammonites, advancing against you, you said to me, ‘No! A king must rule us,’ even though the L
ORD
your God is your king.
h
Warnings for People and King.
13
“Now here is the king you chose. See! The L
ORD
has given you a king.
i
14
If you fear and serve the L
ORD
, if you listen to the voice of the L
ORD
and do not rebel against the L
ORD
’s command, if both you and the king, who rules over you, follow the L
ORD
your God—well and good.
15
But if you do not listen to the voice of the L
ORD
and if you rebel against the L
ORD
’s command, the hand of the L
ORD
will be against you and your king.
16
Now then, stand ready to witness the great marvel the L
ORD
is about to accomplish before your eyes.
17
Are we not in the harvest time for wheat?
*
Yet I will call upon the L
ORD
, and he will send thunder and rain. Thus you will see and understand how great an evil it is in the eyes of the L
ORD
that you have asked for a king.”
j
18
Samuel called upon the L
ORD
, and the L
ORD
sent thunder and rain that day.
Assistance Promised.
Then all the people feared the L
ORD
and Samuel.
19
They said to Samuel, “Pray to the L
ORD
your God for us, your servants, that we may not die for having added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king.”
20
“Do not fear,” Samuel answered them. “You have indeed committed all this evil! Yet do not turn from the L
ORD
, but serve him with your whole heart.
21
Do not turn aside to gods who are nothing,
*
who cannot act and deliver. They are nothing.
k
22
For the sake of his own great name
*
the L
ORD
will not abandon his people, since the L
ORD
has decided to make you his people.
l
23
As for me, far be it from me to sin against the L
ORD
by ceasing to pray for you and to teach you the good and right way.
m
24
But you must fear the L
ORD
and serve him faithfully with all your heart, for you have seen the great things the L
ORD
has done among you.
25
If instead you continue to do evil, both you and your king shall be swept away.”
* [
12:1
–
25
] This chapter narrates the transition from the leadership of the judges to the rule of the king. The Deuteronomistic redactor has Samuel contrast the wickedness of Israel’s ancestors with the Lord’s gracious deliverance (vv.
6
–
12
). The people realize that their demand for a king has compounded that wickedness. Now that the Lord has given them a king, Samuel urges the people and their king to serve the Lord wholeheartedly (vv.
13
–
25
).
* [
12:1
–
5
] Samuel’s upright leadership is set in sharp contrast to the despotic powers of the king described in chap.
8
. By their testimony, the people witness to Samuel’s righteousness.
* [
12:17
]
Harvest time for wheat
: in May–June. Since this is a period of little or no rainfall in Israel, the people will not mistake the sign for a natural phenomenon.
* [
12:21
]
Gods who are nothing
: Hebrew
tohu
, lit., “emptiness,” cf.
Gn 1:2
(
…webohu
); here, idols without power or substance, as in
Is 41:29
.
* [
12:22
]
His own great name
: were the Lord to abandon his people, even if they abandon him, he would diminish his stature or reputation in the divine council or among the nations (e.g.,
Ez 20:9
). Throughout the Old Testament the Lord is encouraged to deliver Israel, despite its evil, “for the sake of his name.”
