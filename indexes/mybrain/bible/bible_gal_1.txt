CHAPTER 1
I. Address
Greeting.
*
1
a
Paul, an apostle
*
not from human beings nor through a human being but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead,
b
2
*
and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:
3
grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
4
*
who gave himself for our sins that he might rescue us from the present evil age in accord with the will of our God and Father,
c
5
to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
d
II. Loyalty to the Gospel
*
6
e
I am amazed that you are so quickly forsaking the one who called you
*
by [the] grace [of Christ] for a different gospel
7
(not that there is another). But there are some who are disturbing you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.
8
f
But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach [to you] a gospel other than the one that we preached to you, let that one be accursed!
*
9
As we have said before, and now I say again, if anyone preaches to you a gospel other than the one that you received, let that one be accursed!
10
g
Am I now currying favor with human beings or God? Or am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ.
*
III. Paul’s Defense of His Gospel and His Authority
*
His Call by Christ.
11
h
Now I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel preached by me is not of human origin.
12
For I did not receive it from a human being, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
*
13
*
For you heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it,
i
14
and progressed in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my race, since I was even more a zealot for my ancestral traditions.
j
15
But when [God], who from my mother’s womb had set me apart and called me through his grace, was pleased
k
16
to reveal his Son to me,
l
so that I might proclaim him to the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult flesh and blood,
*
17
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; rather, I went into Arabia
*
and then returned to Damascus.
18
*
Then after three years
*
I went up to Jerusalem to confer with Cephas and remained with him for fifteen days.
m
19
But I did not see any other of the apostles,
n
only James the brother of the Lord.
*
20
(As to what I am writing to you, behold, before God, I am not lying.)
o
21
Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
p
22
And I was unknown personally to the churches of Judea that are in Christ;
23
they only kept hearing that “the one who once was persecuting us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”
q
24
So they glorified God because of me.
* [
1:1
–
5
] See note on
Rom 1:1
–
7
, concerning the greeting.
* [
1:1
]
Apostle
: because of attacks on his authority in Galatia, Paul defends his apostleship. He is not an apostle commissioned by a congregation (
Phil 2:25
;
2 Cor 8:23
) or even by prophets (
1 Tm 1:18
;
4:14
) but
through Jesus Christ and God the Father
.
* [
1:2
]
All the brothers
: fellow believers in Christ, male and female; cf.
Gal 3:27
–
28
. Paul usually mentions the co-sender(s) at the start of a letter, but the use of all is unique, adding weight to the letter.
Galatia
: central Turkey more likely than the Roman province of Galatia; see Introduction.
* [
1:4
] The greeting in v.
3
is expanded by a christological formula that stresses deliverance through the Lord Jesus from a world dominated by Satan; cf.
2 Cor 4:4
;
Eph 2:2
;
6:12
.
* [
1:6
–
10
] In place of the usual thanksgiving (see note on
Rom 1:8
), Paul, with little to be thankful for in the Galatian situation, expresses amazement at the way his converts are deserting the gospel of Christ for a perverted message. He reasserts the one gospel he has preached (
Gal 1:7
–
9
) and begins to defend himself (
Gal 1:10
).
* [
1:6
]
The one who called you
: God or Christ, though in actuality Paul was the divine instrument to call the Galatians.
* [
1:8
]
Accursed
: in Greek,
anathema
; cf.
Rom 9:3
;
1 Cor 12:3
;
16:22
.
* [
1:10
] This charge by Paul’s opponents, that he sought to conciliate people with flattery and to curry favor with God, might refer to his mission practices (cf.
1 Cor 9:19
–
23
) but the word
still
suggests it refers to his pre-Christian days (cf.
Gal 1:14
;
Phil 3:6
). The self-description
slave of Christ
is one Paul often uses in a greeting (
Rom 1:1
).
* [
1:11
–
2:21
] Paul’s presentation on behalf of his message and of his apostleship reflects rhetorical forms of his day: he first narrates the facts about certain past events (
Gal 1:12
–
2:14
) and then states his contention regarding justification by faith as the gospel message (
Gal 2:15
–
21
). Further arguments follow from both experience and scripture in
Galatians 3
;
4
before he draws out the ethical consequences (
Gal 5:1
–
6:10
). The specific facts that he takes up here to show that his gospel is not a human invention (
Gal 1:11
) but
came through a revelation of Jesus Christ
(
Gal 1:12
) deal with his own calling as a Christian missionary (
Gal 1:13
–
17
), his initial relations with the apostles in Jerusalem (
Gal 1:18
–
24
), a later journey to Jerusalem (
Gal 2:1
–
10
), and an incident in Antioch involving Cephas and persons from James (
Gal 2:11
–
14
). The content of Paul’s revealed gospel is then set forth in the heart of the letter (
Gal 2:15
–
21
).
* [
1:12
] Although Paul received his gospel
through a revelation
from Christ, this did not exclude his use of early Christian confessional formulations. See note on
Gal 1:4
.
* [
1:13
–
17
] Along with
Phil 3:4
–
11
, which also moves from autobiography to its climax in a discussion on justification by faith (cf.
Gal 2:15
–
21
), this passage is Paul’s chief account of the change from his
former way of life
(
Gal 1:13
) to service as a Christian missionary (
Gal 1:16
); cf.
Acts 9:1
–
22
;
22:4
–
16
;
26:9
–
18
. Paul himself does not use the term “conversion” but stresses revelation (
Gal 1:12
,
16
). In
Gal 1:15
his language echoes the Old Testament prophetic call of Jeremiah. Unlike the account in Acts (cf.
Acts 22:4
–
16
), the calling of Paul here includes the mission to proclaim Christ
to the Gentiles
(
Gal 1:16
).
* [
1:16
]
Flesh and blood
: human authorities (cf.
Mt 16:17
;
1 Cor 15:50
). Paul’s apostleship comes from God (
Gal 1:1
).
* [
1:17
]
Arabia
: probably the region of the Nabataean Arabs, east and south of Damascus.
* [
1:18
–
24
] Paul’s first journey to Jerusalem as a Christian, according to Galatians (cf.
Acts 9:23
–
31
and the note on
Acts 12:25
). He is quite explicit about contacts there, testifying under oath (
Gal 1:20
). On returning to Syria (perhaps specifically Damascus, cf.
Gal 1:17
)
and Cilicia
(including his home town Tarsus, cf.
Acts 9:30
;
22:3
), Paul most likely engaged in missionary work. He underscores the fact that Christians in Judea knew of him only by reputation.
* [
1:18
]
After three years
: two years and more, since Paul’s call. To
confer with
Cephas may mean simply “pay a visit” or more specifically “get information from” him about Jesus, over a two-week period.
Cephas
: Aramaic name of Simon (Peter); cf.
Mt 16:16
–
18
and the notes there.
* [
1:19
]
James the brother of the Lord
: not one of the Twelve, but a brother of Jesus (see note on
Mk 6:3
). He played an important role in the Jerusalem church (see note on
Gal 2:9
), the leadership of which he took over from Peter (
Acts 12:17
). Paul may have regarded James as an apostle.
