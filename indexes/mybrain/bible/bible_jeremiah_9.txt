CHAPTER 9
The Corruption of the People
1
Oh, that I had in the wilderness
a travelers’ lodging!
That I might leave my people
and depart from them.
They are all adulterers,
a band of traitors.
2
They ready their tongues like a drawn bow;
with lying, and not with truth,
they are powerful in the land.
They go from evil to evil,
and me they do not know—oracle of the L
ORD
.
3
Be on your guard, everyone against his neighbor;
put no trust in any brother.
Every brother imitates Jacob, the supplanter,
*
every neighbor is guilty of slander.
4
Each one deceives the other,
no one speaks the truth.
They have accustomed their tongues to lying,
they are perverse and cannot repent.
a
5
Violence upon violence,
deceit upon deceit:
They refuse to know me—
oracle of the L
ORD
.
6
Therefore, thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
I will refine them and test them;
how else should I deal with the daughter of my people?
7
A murderous arrow is their tongue,
their mouths utter deceit;
They speak peaceably with their neighbors,
but in their hearts they lay an ambush!
b
8
Should I not punish them for these deeds—oracle of the L
ORD
;
on a nation such as this should I not take vengeance?
c
Dirge over the Ravaged Land
9
Over the mountains I shall break out in cries of lamentation,
over the pastures in the wilderness, in a dirge:
They are scorched, and no one crosses them,
no sound of lowing cattle;
Birds of the air as well as beasts,
all have fled and are gone.
d
10
I will turn Jerusalem into a heap of ruins,
a haunt of jackals;
The cities of Judah I will make a waste,
where no one dwells.
e
11
Who is wise enough to understand this? To whom has the mouth of the L
ORD
spoken? Let him declare it!
Why is the land ravaged,
scorched like a wilderness no one crosses?
f
12
The L
ORD
said: Because they have abandoned my law, which I set before them, and did not listen to me or follow it,
13
but followed instead their stubborn hearts and the Baals, as their ancestors had taught them,
g
14
therefore, thus says the L
ORD
of hosts, the God of Israel: See now, I will give this people wormwood to eat and poisoned water to drink.
h
15
I will scatter them among nations whom neither they nor their ancestors have known; I will send the sword to pursue them until I have completely destroyed them.
i
16
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts:
Inquire, and call the wailing women to come;
summon the most skilled of them.
17
Let them come quickly
and raise for us a dirge,
That our eyes may run with tears,
our pupils flow with water.
j
18
The sound of the dirge is heard from Zion:
We are ruined and greatly ashamed;
We have left the land,
given up our dwellings!
19
Hear, you women, the word of the L
ORD
,
let your ears receive the word of his mouth.
Teach your daughters a dirge,
and each other a lament:
20
Death has come up through our windows,
has entered our citadels,
To cut down children in the street,
young people in the squares.
k
21
Corpses shall fall
like dung in the open field,
Like sheaves behind the harvester,
with no one to gather them.
True Glory
22
Thus says the L
ORD
:
Let not the wise boast of his wisdom,
nor the strong boast of his strength,
nor the rich man boast of his riches;
23
But rather, let those who boast, boast of this,
that in their prudence they know me,
l
Know that I, the L
ORD
, act with fidelity,
justice, and integrity on earth.
How I take delight in these—oracle of the L
ORD
.
False Circumcision.
24
See, days are coming—oracle of the L
ORD
—when I will demand an account of all those circumcised in the foreskin:
m
25
Egypt and Judah, Edom and the Ammonites, Moab, and those who live in the wilderness and shave their temples.
*
For all the nations are uncircumcised, even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised at heart.
* [
9:3
]
Jacob, the supplanter
: in Hebrew, a play on words. In the popular etymology given in
Gn 25:26
, the name Jacob means “he supplants,” for he deprived his brother Esau of his birthright (cf.
Gn 25:33
).
* [
9:25
]
Shave their temples
: some Arabian tribes practiced this custom. None of the nations who practice circumcision understand the meaning of their action, not even Israel; no one conforms to life under the covenant.
