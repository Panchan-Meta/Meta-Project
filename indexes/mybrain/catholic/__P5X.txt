PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST SECTION ONE MAN'S VOCATION LIFE IN THE SPIRIT CHAPTER ONE THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON Article 5 THE MORALITY OF THE PASSIONS IN BRIEF Previous - Next IN BRIEF 1771 The term "passions" refers to the affections or the feelings. By his emotions man intuits the good and suspects evil. 1772 The principal passions are love and hatred, desire and fear, joy, sadness, and anger. 1773 In the passions, as movements of the sensitive appetite, there is neither moral good nor evil. But insofar as they engage reason and will, there is moral good or evil in them. 1774 Emotions and feelings can be taken up in the virtues or perverted by the vices. 1775 The perfection of the moral good consists in man's being moved to the good not only by his will but also by his "heart."
