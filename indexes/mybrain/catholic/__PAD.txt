PART FOUR: CHRISTIAN PRAYER SECTION TWO THE LORD'S PRAYER Article 4 THE FINAL DOXOLOGY Previous - Next Article 4 THE FINAL DOXOLOGY 2855 The final doxology, "For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours, now and forever," takes up again, by inclusion, the first three petitions to our Father: the glorification of his name, the coming of his reign, and the power of his saving will. But these prayers are now proclaimed as adoration and thanksgiving, as in the liturgy of heaven. 176 The ruler of this world has mendaciously attributed to himself the three titles of kingship, power, and glory. 177 Christ, the Lord, restores them to his Father and our Father, until he hands over the kingdom to him when the mystery of salvation will be brought to its completion and God will be all in all. 178 2856 "Then, after the prayer is over you say 'Amen,' which means 'So be it,' thus ratifying with our 'Amen' what is contained in the prayer that God has taught us." 179 176 Cf. Rev 1:6; 4:11; 5:13. 177 Cf. Lk 4:5-6. 178 1 Cor 15:24-28. 179 St. Cyril of Jerusalem, Catech. myst. 5,18: PG 33, 1124; cf. Cf. Lk 1:38. Previous - Next Copyright © Libreria Editrice Vaticana
