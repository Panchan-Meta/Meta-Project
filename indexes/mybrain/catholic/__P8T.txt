PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS CHAPTER TWO YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF Article 10 THE TENTH COMMANDMENT Previous - Next Article 10 THE TENTH COMMANDMENT You shall not covet ... anything that is your neighbor's.... You shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant,, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your neighbor's. 316 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 317 2534 The tenth commandment unfolds and completes the ninth, which is concerned with concupiscence of the flesh. It forbids coveting the goods of another, as the root of theft, robbery, and fraud, which the seventh commandment forbids. "Lust of the eyes" leads to the violence and injustice forbidden by the fifth commandment. 318 Avarice, like fornication, originates in the idolatry prohibited by the first three prescriptions of the Law. 319 The tenth commandment concerns the intentions of the heart; with the ninth, it summarizes all the precepts of the Law. 316 EX 20:17; Deut 5:21. 317 Mt 6:21. 318 Cf. 1 Jn 2:16; Mic 2:2. 319 Cf.
