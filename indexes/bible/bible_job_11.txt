CHAPTER 11
Zophar’s First Speech.
1
And Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
2
Should not many words be answered,
or must the garrulous man necessarily be right?
3
Shall your babblings keep others silent,
and shall you deride and no one give rebuke?
4
Shall you say: “My teaching is pure,
and I am clean in your sight”?
5
But oh, that God would speak,
*
and open his lips against you,
6
And tell you the secrets of wisdom,
for good sense has two sides;
So you might learn that God
overlooks some of your sinfulness.
7
Can you find out the depths of God?
a
or find out the perfection of the Almighty?
8
It is higher than the heavens; what can you do?
It is deeper than Sheol; what can you know?
9
It is longer than the earth in measure,
and broader than the sea.
10
If he should seize and imprison
or call to judgment, who then could turn him back?
11
For he knows the worthless
and sees iniquity; will he then ignore it?
12
An empty head will gain understanding,
when a colt of a wild jackass
b
is born human.
*
13
If you set your heart aright
and stretch out your hands toward him,
14
If iniquity is in your hand, remove it,
and do not let injustice dwell in your tent,
15
Surely then you may lift up your face in innocence;
you may stand firm and unafraid.
16
For then you shall forget your misery,
like water that has ebbed away you shall regard it.
17
Then your life shall be brighter than the noonday;
its gloom shall become like the morning,
18
And you shall be secure, because there is hope;
you shall look round you and lie down in safety;
c
19
you shall lie down and no one will disturb you.
Many shall entreat your favor,
20
but the wicked, looking on, shall be consumed with envy.
Escape shall be cut off from them,
their only hope their last breath.
* [
11:5
] This is another of many ironies (e.g., cf.
11:16
–
19
) that occur throughout the book. Zophar does not know that God will speak (chaps.
38
–
42
), but contrary to what he thinks.
* [
11:12
]
A colt…is born human
: the Hebrew is obscure. As translated, it seems to be a proverb referring to an impossible event.
