PSALM 138
*
Hymn of a Grateful Heart
1
Of David.
I
I thank you, Lord, with all my heart;
a
in the presence of the angels
*
to you I sing.
2
I bow low toward your holy temple;
I praise your name for your mercy and faithfulness.
For you have exalted over all
your name and your promise.
3
On the day I cried out, you answered;
you strengthened my spirit.
II
4
All the kings of earth will praise you, L
ORD
,
when they hear the words of your mouth.
5
They will sing of the ways of the L
ORD
:
“How great is the glory of the L
ORD
!”
6
The L
ORD
is on high, but cares for the lowly
b
and knows the proud from afar.
7
Though I walk in the midst of dangers,
you guard my life when my enemies rage.
You stretch out your hand;
your right hand saves me.
8
The L
ORD
is with me to the end.
L
ORD
, your mercy endures forever.
Never forsake the work of your hands!
* [
Psalm 138
] A thanksgiving to God, who came to the rescue of the psalmist. Divine rescue was not the result of the psalmist’s virtues but of God’s loving fidelity (
Ps 138:1
–
3
). The act is not a private transaction but a public act that stirs the surrounding nations to praise God’s greatness and care for the people (
Ps 138:4
–
6
). The psalmist, having experienced salvation, trusts that God will always be there in moments of danger (
Ps 138:7
–
8
).
* [
138:1
]
In the presence of the angels
: heavenly beings who were completely subordinate to Israel’s God. The earthly Temple represents the heavenly palace of God.
a. [
138:1
]
Ps 9:1
.
b. [
138:6
]
Lk 1:51
–
