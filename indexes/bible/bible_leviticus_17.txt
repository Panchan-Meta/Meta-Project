CHAPTER 17
Sacredness of Blood.
1
The L
ORD
said to Moses:
2
Speak to Aaron and his sons, as well as to all the Israelites, and tell them: This is what the L
ORD
has commanded:
3
*
Any Israelite who slaughters an ox or a sheep or a goat, whether in the camp or outside of it,
4
without first bringing it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the L
ORD
in front of the L
ORD
’s tabernacle, shall be judged guilty of bloodshed
*
a
—that individual has shed blood, and shall be cut off
b
from the people.
5
This is so that such sacrifices as they used to offer in the open field the Israelites shall henceforth bring to the L
ORD
at the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them there as communion sacrifices to the L
ORD
.
c
6
The priest will splash the blood on the altar of the L
ORD
at the entrance of the tent of meeting and burn the fat for an odor pleasing to the L
ORD
.
7
No longer shall they offer their sacrifices to the demons
*
with whom they prostituted themselves.
d
This shall be an everlasting statute for them and their descendants.
8
Tell them, therefore: Anyone, whether of the house of Israel or of the aliens residing among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice
9
without bringing it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to the L
ORD
, shall be cut off from the people.
10
e
As for anyone, whether of the house of Israel or of the aliens residing among them, who consumes any blood, I will set myself against that individual and will cut that person off from among the people,
11
since the life of the flesh is in the blood,
f
and I have given it to you to make atonement
*
on the altar for yourselves, because it is the blood as life that makes atonement.
12
That is why I have told the Israelites: No one among you, not even a resident alien, may consume blood.
13
Anyone hunting,
*
whether of the Israelites or of the aliens residing among them, who catches an animal or a bird that may be eaten, shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth,
g
14
since the life of all flesh is its blood. I have told the Israelites: You shall not consume the blood of any flesh. Since the life of all flesh is its blood, anyone who consumes it shall be cut off.
15
Everyone, whether a native or an alien, who eats of an animal that died of itself or was killed by a wild beast, shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening, and then become clean.
h
16
If one does not wash his garments and bathe, that person shall bear the penalty.
* [
17:3
–
4
] Any animal slaughtered must be brought to the tent of meeting as an offering. This differs from
Dt 12:15
–
28
, which allows those living too far from the temple to slaughter an animal for food at home without offering it as a sacrifice.
* [
17:4
]
Guilty of bloodshed
: human beings and animals can incur blood guilt for killing human beings (cf.
Gn 9:5
–
6
); human beings can incur blood guilt for killing animals (see note on
Lv 24:17
–
22
).
* [
17:7
]
Demons
: for Hebrew
śe‘îrîm
, lit., “goats.” Like the demon Azazel (cf.
16:8
,
10
,
21
–
22
), they dwell in the open country (
17:5
). Cf.
Is 13:21
;
34:14
.
* [
17:11
]
To make atonement
: this is probably to be understood in the context of liability for shedding animal blood (cf. v.
4
). Placing the blood on the altar exonerates the slaughterer from guilt for the killing. See note on
16:6
.
* [
17:13
]
Hunting
: game animals are not permitted as offerings. One nonetheless has to treat the blood of these animals carefully by covering it with earth. Cf.
Dt 12:16
