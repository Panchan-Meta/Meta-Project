PSALM 110
*
God Appoints the King both King and Priest
1
A psalm of David.
The L
ORD
says to my lord:
*
“Sit at my right hand,
while I make your enemies your footstool.”
*
a
2
The scepter of your might:
the L
ORD
extends your strong scepter from Zion.
Have dominion over your enemies!
3
Yours is princely power from the day of your birth.
In holy splendor before the daystar,
like dew I begot you.
b
4
The L
ORD
has sworn and will not waver:
“You are a priest forever in the manner of Melchizedek.”
*
c
5
At your right hand is the Lord,
who crushes kings on the day of his wrath,
d
6
Who judges nations, heaps up corpses,
crushes heads across the wide earth,
7
*
Who drinks from the brook by the wayside
and thus holds high his head.
e
* [
Psalm 110
] A royal Psalm in which a court singer recites three oracles in which God assures the king that his enemies are conquered (
Ps 110:1
–
2
), makes the king “son” in traditional adoption language (
Ps 110:3
), gives priestly status to the king and promises to be with him in future military ventures (
Ps 110:4
–
7
).
* [
110:1
]
The L
ORD
says to my lord
: a polite form of address of an inferior to a superior, cf.
1 Sm 25:25
;
2 Sm 1:10
. The court singer refers to the king. Jesus in the synoptic gospels (
Mt 22:41
–
46
and parallels) takes the psalmist to be David and hence “my lord” refers to the messiah, who must be someone greater than David.
Your footstool
: in ancient times victorious kings put their feet on the prostrate bodies of their enemies.
* [
110:4
]
Melchizedek
: Melchizedek was the ancient king of Salem (Jerusalem) who blessed Abraham (
Gn 14:18
–
20
); like other kings of the time he performed priestly functions.
Heb 7
sees in Melchizedek a type of Christ.
* [
110:7
]
Who drinks from the brook by the wayside
: the meaning is uncertain. Some see an allusion to a rite of royal consecration at the Gihon spring (cf.
1 Kgs 1:33
,
38
). Others find here an image of the divine warrior (or king) pursuing enemies so relentlessly that he does not stop long enough to eat and drink.
