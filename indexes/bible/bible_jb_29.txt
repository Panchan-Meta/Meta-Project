CHAPTER 29
VI. JOB'S FINAL SUMMARY OF HIS CAUSE
1
*
Job took up his theme again and said:
2
Oh, that I were as in the months past,
as in the days when God watched over me:
a
3
While he kept his lamp shining above my head,
and by his light I walked through darkness;
4
As I was in my flourishing days,
when God sheltered my tent;
5
When the Almighty was still with me,
and my children were round about me;
6
When my footsteps were bathed in cream,
and the rock flowed with streams of oil.
*
7
Whenever I went out to the gate of the city
and took my seat in the square,
8
The young men saw me and withdrew,
and the elders rose up and stood;
9
Officials refrained from speaking
and covered their mouths with their hands;
b
10
The voice of the princes was silenced,
and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.
11
The ear that heard blessed me;
the eye that saw acclaimed me.
12
For I rescued the poor who cried out for help,
the orphans, and the unassisted;
13
The blessing of those in extremity came upon me,
and the heart of the widow I made joyful.
14
I wore my righteousness like a garment;
justice was my robe and my turban.
15
I was eyes to the blind,
and feet to the lame was I.
16
I was a father to the poor;
the complaint of the stranger I pursued,
17
And I broke the jaws of the wicked man;
from his teeth I forced the prey.
18
I said: “In my own nest I shall grow old;
I shall multiply years like the phoenix.
*
19
My root is spread out to the waters;
the dew rests by night on my branches.
20
My glory is fresh within me,
and my bow is renewed in my hand!”
21
For me they listened and waited;
they were silent for my counsel.
22
Once I spoke, they said no more,
but received my pronouncement drop by drop.
23
They waited for me as for the rain;
they drank in my words like the spring rains.
24
When I smiled on them they could not believe it;
they would not let the light of my face be dimmed.
25
I decided their course and sat at their head,
I lived like a king among the troops,
like one who comforts mourners.

31:40
