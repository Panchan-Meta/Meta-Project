CHAPTER 25
*
Against Ammon.
1
The word of the L
ORD
came to me:
2
Son of man, turn toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
a
3
Say to the Ammonites: Hear the word of the L
ORD
! Thus says the Lord G
OD
: Because you jeered at my sanctuary when it was desecrated, at the land of Israel when it was destroyed, and at the house of Judah when they went into exile,
4
therefore I am giving you to people from the east
*
as a possession. They shall set up their encampments among you and pitch their tents in your midst; they shall eat your produce and drink your milk.
b
5
And I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and all of Ammon into a grazing place for flocks. Then you shall know that I am the L
ORD
.
6
For thus says the Lord G
OD
: Because you rejoiced over the land of Israel with scorn in your heart, clapping your hands and stamping your feet,
7
therefore, see, I am stretching out my hand against you and giving you up as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and wipe you out of the lands. I will destroy you, and you shall know that I am the L
ORD
.
c
Against Moab.
8
d
Thus says the Lord G
OD
: Because Moab said, “See! the house of Judah is like all the other nations,”
9
therefore, I am exposing the whole flank of Moab
*
with its cities, the jewels of its land: Beth-jesimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim.
10
I will hand it over, along with the Ammonites, to the people from the east that it may not be remembered among the nations.
11
I will execute judgment upon Moab that they may know that I am the L
ORD
.
e
Against Edom.
12
f
Thus says the Lord G
OD
: Because Edom took vengeance on the house of Judah and incurred terrible guilt by taking vengeance on them,
13
therefore thus says the Lord G
OD
: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it human being and beast alike. I will turn it into ruins from Teman to Dedan; they shall fall by the sword.
g
14
I will put my vengeance against Edom into the hands of my people Israel; they will deal with Edom in accord with my furious anger. Thus they shall know my vengeance!—oracle of the Lord G
OD
.
h
Against the Philistines.
15
Thus says the Lord G
OD
: Because the Philistines acted vengefully and exacted vengeance with intentional malice, destroying with undying hostility,
i
16
therefore thus says the Lord G
OD
: See! I am stretching out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites
*
and wipe out the remnant on the seacoast.
17
Thus I will execute great acts of vengeance on them, punishing them furiously. Then they shall know that I am the L
ORD
, when I wreak my vengeance on them.
* [
25:1
–
32:32
] These chapters form a body of oracles directed against foreign nations. They follow the prophet’s condemnation of Judah and oracles announcing its destruction. The unit precedes the announcement of Judah’s salvation in chaps.

* [
25:1
–
17
] Ezekiel condemns four nations for their reactions to Judah’s destruction and exile: Ammon to the east (vv.
2
–
7
); Moab to the southeast (vv.
8
–
11
); Edom to the south (vv.
12
–
14
); Philistia to the west (vv.
15
–
17
). Their hostility was not unprovoked; at one time or another, each one either lost territory to Israel or had been under Israelite control.
* [
25:4
]
People from the east
: nomadic tribes from the desert east of Ammon and Moab (cf.
Is 11:14
;
Jer 49:28
), often a threat to outlying towns and villages.
* [
25:9
]
The whole flank of Moab
: the eastern edge of the Moabite plateau, perhaps lightly fortified because the vast desert to the east provided a natural barrier to invasion.
* [
25:16
]
Cherethites
: people from the island of Crete in the Aegean, the Philistines’ point of origin. In
Zep 2:5
, the terms “Philistines,” “Cherethites,” and “seacoast people” describe the same group of people.
