CHAPTER 3
Hosea and His Wife Reunited.
*
1
Again the L
ORD
said to me:
Go, love a woman
who is loved by her spouse but commits adultery;
Just as the L
ORD
loves the Israelites,
though they turn to other gods
and love raisin cakes.
*
2
*
So I acquired her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a lethech of barley.
3
Then I said to her:
“You will wait for me for many days;
you will not prostitute yourself
Or belong to any man;
I in turn will wait for you.”
4
*
For the Israelites will remain many days
without king or prince,
Without sacrifice or sacred pillar,
without ephod or household gods.
5
Afterward the Israelites will turn back
and seek the L
ORD
, their God,
and David, their king;
*
a
They will come trembling to the L
ORD
and to his bounty, in the last days.
* [
3:1
–
5
] Just as the Lord is ready to take Israel back, Hosea takes his wife back. She must undergo a period of purification, just as Israel must experience purification before the restoration of the covenant relationship.
* [
3:1
]
Raisin cakes
: offerings to the fertility goddess Asherah, the female counterpart of Baal, cf.
Jer 7:18
;
44:19
;
Dn 14:5
–
8
.
* [
3:2
] Just as the Lord offered a new bride price to Israel (
2:21
–
22
), so Hosea offers a new bride price to his wife. He returns to her what he has taken away from her (
2:5
): “fifteen (shekels) of silver”; “a homer of barley,” a unit of dry measurement, which according to the etymology means “a mulehttps://bible.usccb.org/bible/35-dn-az/014?005#34014005 load”; and “a lethech of barley,” which is a half-homer.
* [
3:4
] Israel will lose its political and cultic institutions.
Sacred pillar
: originally perhaps a phallic symbol, representing Baal. These were also used in Israelite worship (cf. notes on
Gn 28:18
;
Ex 34:13
).
Ephod
: an instrument used in consulting the deity (
1 Sm 23:6
–
12
;
30:7
; cf. notes on
Ex 28:6
,
15
–
30
).
Household gods
: in Hebrew,
teraphim
; images regarded as the tutelary deities of the household (
Gn 31:19
;
Jgs 17:5
;
18:14
,
17
–
18
).
* [
3:5
]
David, their king
: the king belonging to the line of David who will restore the Israelite nation (
Jer 23:5
;
Ez 34:23
,
24
).
The last days
: a future time of transformation.
