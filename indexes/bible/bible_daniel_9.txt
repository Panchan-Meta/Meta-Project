CHAPTER 9
The Seventy Weeks of Years.
1
It was the first year that Darius,
*
son of Ahasuerus, of the race of the Medes, reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans;
2
a
in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived in the books the number of years the L
ORD
had decreed to the prophet Jeremiah: Jerusalem was to lie in ruins for seventy years.
*
3
I turned to the Lord God, to seek help, in prayer and petition, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
4
b
I prayed to the L
ORD
, my God, and confessed, “Ah, Lord, great and awesome God, you who keep your covenant and show mercy toward those who love you and keep your commandments and your precepts!
5
We have sinned, been wicked and done evil; we have rebelled and turned from your commandments and your laws.
6
We have not obeyed your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, our ancestors, and all the people of the land.
7
Justice, O Lord, is on your side; we are shamefaced even to this day: the men of Judah, the residents of Jerusalem, and all Israel, near and far, in all the lands to which you have scattered them because of their treachery toward you.
8
O L
ORD
, we are ashamed, like our kings, our princes, and our ancestors, for having sinned against you.
9
But to the Lord, our God, belong compassion and forgiveness, though we rebelled against him
10
and did not hear the voice of the L
ORD
, our God, by walking in his laws given through his servants the prophets.
11
c
The curse and the oath written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, were poured out over us for our sins, because all Israel transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to hear your voice.
12
He fulfilled the words he spoke against us and against those who ruled us, by bringing upon us an evil—no evil so great has happened under heaven as happened in Jerusalem.
13
As it is written
*
in the law of Moses, this evil has come upon us. We did not appease the L
ORD
, our God, by turning back from our wickedness and acting according to your truth,
14
so the L
ORD
kept watch over the evil and brought it upon us. The L
ORD
, our God, is just in all that he has done: we did not listen to his voice.
15
“Now, Lord, our God, who led your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and made a name for yourself even to this day, we have sinned, we are guilty.
16
Lord, in keeping with all your just deeds, let your anger and your wrath be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. On account of our sins and the crimes of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people have become the reproach of all our neighbors.
17
Now, our God, hear the prayer and petition of your servant; and for your own sake, Lord, let your face shine upon your desolate sanctuary.
18
Give ear, my God, and listen; open your eyes and look upon our desolate city upon which your name is invoked. When we present our petition before you, we rely not on our just deeds, but on your great mercy.
19
Lord, hear! Lord, pardon! Lord, be attentive and act without delay, for your own sake, my God, because your name is invoked upon your city and your people!”
20
I was still praying to the L
ORD
, my God, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, presenting my petition concerning the holy mountain of my God—
21
I was still praying, when the man, Gabriel, whom I had seen in vision before, came to me in flight at the time of the evening offering.
*
22
He instructed me in these words: “Daniel, I have now come to give you understanding.
23
When you began your petition, an answer was given which I have come to announce, because you are beloved. Therefore, mark the answer and understand the vision.
24
“Seventy weeks
*
are decreed
for your people and for your holy city:
Then transgression will stop and sin will end,
guilt will be expiated,
Everlasting justice will be introduced,
vision and prophecy ratified,
and a holy of holies will be anointed.
25
Know and understand:
From the utterance of the word
that Jerusalem was to be rebuilt
*
Until there is an anointed ruler,
there shall be seven weeks.
In the course of sixty-two weeks
it shall be rebuilt,
With squares and trenches,
in time of affliction.
26
After the sixty-two weeks
an anointed one
*
shall be cut down
with no one to help him.
And the people of a leader who will come
shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.
His end shall come in a flood;
until the end of the war, which is decreed,
there will be desolation.
27
For one week
*
he shall make
a firm covenant with the many;
Half the week
he shall abolish sacrifice and offering;
In their place shall be the desolating abomination
until the ruin that is decreed
is poured out upon the desolator.”

Seventy years
: Jeremiah was understood to prophesy a Babylonian captivity of seventy years, a round number signifying the complete passing away of the existing generation (
Jer 25:11
;
29:10
). On this view Jeremiah’s prophecy was seen to be fulfilled in the capture of Babylon by Cyrus and the subsequent return of the Jews to Palestine. However, the author of Daniel, living during the persecution of Antiochus, extends Jeremiah’s number to seventy weeks of years (
Dn 9:24
), i.e., seven times seventy years, to encompass the period of Seleucid persecution.
* [
9:13
]
As it is written
: the first time that this formula of Scriptural citation is used in the Bible. The reference (v.
11
) is to the sanctions of
Lv 26:14
–
16
;
Dt 28:15
–
17
.
* [
9:21
]
At the time of the evening offering
: between three and four in the afternoon.
* [
9:24
]
Seventy weeks
: i.e., of years. Just as Jeremiah’s seventy years was an approximation (see note on v.
2
), the four hundred and ninety years here is not to be taken literally. Similarly, the distribution of the “weeks” in the following verses indicates only relative proportions of the total figure.
A holy of holies
: or “most holy”; could be understood as a place (e.g., the Jerusalem Temple) or a person (cf.
1 Chr 23:13
).
* [
9:25
]
From the utterance…to be rebuilt
: from the time of Jeremiah’s prophecy.
Anointed ruler
: either Cyrus, who was called the anointed of the Lord to end the exile (
Is 45:1
), or the high priest Jeshua who presided over the rebuilding of the altar of sacrifice after the exile (
Ezr 3:2
).
Seven weeks
: forty-nine years, an approximation of the time of the exile.
In the course of sixty-two weeks…rebuilt
: a period of four hundred thirty-four years, roughly approximating the interval between the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the exile and the beginning of the Seleucid persecution.
* [
9:26
]
An anointed one
: the high priest Onias III, murdered in 171 B.C., from which the author dates the beginning of the persecution. Onias was in exile when he was killed.
A leader
: Antiochus IV.
* [
9:27
]
One week
: the final phase of the period in view, the time of Antiochus’ persecution.
He
: Antiochus himself.
The many
: the faithless Jews who allied themselves with the Seleucids; cf.
1 Mc 1:11
–
13
.
Half the week
: three and a half years; the Temple was desecrated by Antiochus from 167 to 164 B.C.
The desolating abomination
: see note on
8:13
; probably a pagan altar. Jesus refers to this passage in his prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem in
Mt 24:15
.
