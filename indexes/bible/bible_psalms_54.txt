PSALM 54
*
Confident Prayer in Great Peril
1
For the leader. On stringed instruments. A
maskil
of David,
2
when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, “David is hiding among us.”
a
I
3
O God, by your name
*
save me.
By your strength defend my cause.
4
O God, hear my prayer.
Listen to the words of my mouth.
5
Strangers have risen against me;
the ruthless seek my life;
they do not keep God before them.
b
Selah
II
6
God is present as my helper;
c
the Lord sustains my life.
7
Turn back the evil upon my foes;
in your faithfulness, destroy them.
d
8
Then I will offer you generous sacrifice
and give thanks to your name, L
ORD
, for it is good.
9
Because it has rescued me from every trouble,
and my eyes look down on my foes.

* [
Psalm 54
] A lament in which the person under attack calls directly upon God for help (
Ps 54:3
–
5
). Refusing to despair, the psalmist hopes in God, who is active in history and just (
Ps 54:6
–
7
). The Psalm ends with a serene promise to return thanks (
Ps 54:8
–
9
).
* [
54:3
]
By your name
: one is present in one’s name, hence God as revealed to human beings.
