PSALM 101
*
Norm of Life for Rulers
1
A psalm of David.
I
I sing of mercy and justice;
to you, L
ORD
, I sing praise.
2
I study the way of integrity;
a
when will you come to me?
I act with integrity of heart
within my household.
*
b
3
I do not allow into my presence anything base.
I hate wrongdoing;
I will have no part of it.
c
4
May the devious heart keep far from me;
the wicked I will not acknowledge.
5
Whoever slanders a neighbor in secret
I will reduce to silence.
d
Haughty eyes and arrogant hearts
e
I cannot endure.
II
6
I look to the faithful of the land
*
to sit at my side.
Whoever follows the way of integrity
f
is the one to enter my service.
7
No one who practices deceit
can remain within my house.
No one who speaks falsely
can last in my presence.
g
8
*
Morning after morning I clear all the wicked from the land,
to rid the city of the L
ORD
of all doers of evil.
* [
Psalm 101
] The king, grateful at being God’s chosen (
Ps 101:1
), promises to be a ruler after God’s own heart (
Ps 101:2
–
3
), allowing into the royal service only the God-fearing (
Ps 101:3
–
8
).
* [
101:2
]
Within my household
: the king promises to make his own household, i.e., the royal court, a model for Israel, banning all officials who abuse their power.
* [
101:6
]
I look to the faithful of the land
: the king seeks companions only among those faithful to God.
* [
101:8
]
Morning after morning
: the morning is the normal time for the administration of justice (
2 Sm 15:2
;
Jer 21:12
) and for the arrival of divine aid (
Ps 59:17
;
143:8
;
Is 33:2
).
I clear all the wicked from the land
: the king, as God’s servant, is responsible for seeing that divine justice is carried out.
