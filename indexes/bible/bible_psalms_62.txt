PSALM 62
*
Trust in God Alone
1
For the leader;
‘al Jeduthun
.
*
A psalm of David.
I
2
My soul rests in God alone,
a
from whom comes my salvation.
3
God alone is my rock and salvation,
my fortress; I shall never fall.
4
How long will you set yourself against a man?
You shall all be destroyed,
Like a sagging wall
or a tumbled down fence!
5
Even highly placed people
plot to overthrow him.
They delight in lies;
they bless with their mouths,
but inwardly they curse.
b
Selah
II
6
My soul, be at rest in God alone,
from whom comes my hope.
7
God alone is my rock and my salvation,
my fortress; I shall not fall.
8
My deliverance and honor are with God,
c
my strong rock;
my refuge is with God.
9
Trust God at all times, my people!
Pour out your hearts to God our refuge!
Selah
III
10
Mortals are a mere breath,
the sons of man but an illusion;
d
On a balance they rise;
*
together they weigh nothing.
11
Do not trust in extortion;
in plunder put no empty hope.
On wealth that increases,
do not set your heart.
e
12
*
One thing God has said;
two things I have heard:
f
Strength belongs to God;
13
so too, my Lord, does mercy,
For you repay each man
according to his deeds.
g
* [
Psalm 62
] A song of trust displaying serenity from experiencing God’s power (the refrains of
Ps 62:2
–
3
and
Ps 62:6
–
7
) and anger toward unjust enemies (
Ps 62:4
–
5
). From the experience of being rescued, the psalmist can teach others to trust in God (
Ps 62:9
–
12
).
* [
62:1
]
‘Al Jeduthun
: apparently the Hebrew name for the melody.
* [
62:10
]
On a balance they rise
: precious objects were weighed by balancing two pans suspended from a beam. The lighter pan rises.
* [
62:12
]
One thingâ€¦two things
: parallelism of numbers for the sake of variation, a common device in Semitic poetry. One should not literally add up the numbers, cf.
