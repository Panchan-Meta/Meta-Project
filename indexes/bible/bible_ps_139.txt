PSALM 139
*
The All-knowing and Ever-present God
1
For the leader. A psalm of David.
I
L
ORD
, you have probed me, you know me:
2
you know when I sit and stand;
*
a
you understand my thoughts from afar.
3
You sift through my travels and my rest;
with all my ways you are familiar.
4
Even before a word is on my tongue,
L
ORD
, you know it all.
5
Behind and before you encircle me
and rest your hand upon me.
6
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
far too lofty for me to reach.
b
7
Where can I go from your spirit?
From your presence, where can I flee?
8
If I ascend to the heavens, you are there;
if I lie down in Sheol, there you are.
c
9
If I take the wings of dawn
*
and dwell beyond the sea,
*
10
Even there your hand guides me,
your right hand holds me fast.
11
If I say, “Surely darkness shall hide me,
and night shall be my light”
*
—
12
Darkness is not dark for you,
and night shines as the day.
Darkness and light are but one.
d
II
13
You formed my inmost being;
you knit me in my mother’s womb.
e
14
I praise you, because I am wonderfully made;
wonderful are your works!
My very self you know.
15
My bones are not hidden from you,
When I was being made in secret,
fashioned in the depths of the earth.
*
16
Your eyes saw me unformed;
in your book all are written down;
f
my days were shaped, before one came to be.
III
17
How precious to me are your designs, O God;
how vast the sum of them!
18
Were I to count them, they would outnumber the sands;
when I complete them, still you are with me.
g
19
When you would destroy the wicked, O God,
the bloodthirsty depart from me!
h
20
Your foes who conspire a plot against you
are exalted in vain.
IV
21
Do I not hate, L
ORD
, those who hate you?
Those who rise against you, do I not loathe?
i
22
With fierce hatred I hate them,
enemies I count as my own.
23
Probe me, God, know my heart;
try me, know my thoughts.
j
24
See if there is a wicked path in me;
lead me along an ancient path.

* [
Psalm 139
] A hymnic meditation on God’s omnipresence and omniscience. The psalmist is keenly aware of God’s all-knowing gaze (
Ps 139:1
–
6
), of God’s presence in every part of the universe (
Ps 139:7
–
12
), and of God’s control over the psalmist’s very self (
Ps 139:13
–
16
). Summing up
Ps 139:1
–
16
,
17
–
18
express wonder. There is only one place hostile to God’s rule—wicked people. The psalmist prays to be removed from their company (
Ps 139:19
–
24
).
* [
139:2
]
When I sit and stand
: in all my physical movement.
* [
139:9
]
Take the wings of dawn
: go to the extremities of the east.
Beyond the sea
: uttermost bounds of the west; the sea is the Mediterranean.
* [
139:11
]
Night shall be my light
: night to me is what day is to others.
* [
139:15
]
The depths of the earth
: figurative language for the womb, stressing the hidden and mysterious operations that occur there.
* [
139:24
]
Lead me along an ancient path
: the manner of living of our ancestors, who were faithful to God’s will, cf.
Jer 6:16
