PSALM 8
*
Divine Majesty and Human Dignity
1
For the leader; “upon the
gittith
.”
*
A psalm of David.
2
O L
ORD
, our Lord,
how awesome is your name through all the earth!
I will sing of your majesty above the heavens
3
with the mouths of babes
a
and infants.
*
You have established a bulwark
*
against your foes,
to silence enemy and avenger.
*
4
When I see your heavens, the work of your fingers,
the moon and stars that you set in place—
5
*
What is man that you are mindful of him,
b
and a son of man that you care for him?
c
6
Yet you have made him little less than a god,
*
crowned him with glory and honor.
7
You have given him rule over the works of your hands,
d
put all things at his feet:
8
All sheep and oxen,
even the beasts of the field,
9
The birds of the air, the fish of the sea,
and whatever swims the paths of the seas.
10
O L
ORD
, our Lord,
how awesome is your name through all the earth!
* [
Psalm 8
] While marvelling at the limitless grandeur of God (
Ps 8:2
–
3
), the psalmist is struck first by the smallness of human beings in creation (
Ps 8:4
–
5
), and then by the royal dignity and power that God has graciously bestowed upon them (
Ps 8:6
–
9
).
* [
8:1
]
Upon the gittith
: probably the title of the melody to which the Psalm was to be sung or a musical instrument.
* [
8:3
]
With the mouths of babes and infants
: the psalmist realizes that his attempts to praise such an awesome God are hopelessly inadequate and amount to little more than the sounds made by infants.
Established a bulwark
: an allusion to lost myth telling how God built a fortress for himself in the heavens in primordial times in his battle with the powers of chaos. This “bulwark” is the firmament.
Enemy and avenger
: probably cosmic enemies. The primeval powers of watery chaos are often personified in poetic texts (
Ps 74:13
–
14
;
89:11
;
Jb 9:13
;
26:12
–
13
;
Is 51:9
).
* [
8:5
]
Manâ€¦a son of man
: the emphasis is on the fragility and mortality of human beings to whom God has given great dignity.
* [
8:6
]
Little less than a god
: Hebrew
‘elohim
, the ordinary word for “God” or “the gods” or members of the heavenly court. The Greek version translated ‘
elohim
by “angel, messenger”; several ancient and modern versions so translate. The meaning seems to be that God created human beings almost at the level of the beings in the heavenly world.
Heb 2:9
, translating “for a little while,” finds the eminent fulfillment of this verse in Jesus Christ, who was humbled before being glorified, cf. also
1 Cor 15:27
where St. Paul applies to Christ the closing words of
Ps 8:7
.
