CHAPTER 25
Praise for God’s Deliverance and the Celebration in Zion
*
1
O L
ORD
, you are my God,
I extol you, I praise your name;
For you have carried out your wonderful plans of old,
faithful and true.
a
2
For you have made the city a heap,
the fortified city a ruin,
The castle of the insolent, a city no more,
not ever to be rebuilt.
b
3
Therefore a strong people will honor you,
ruthless nations will fear you.
4
For you have been a refuge to the poor,
a refuge to the needy in their distress;
Shelter from the rain,
shade from the heat.
c
When the blast of the ruthless was like a winter rain,
5
the roar of strangers like heat in the desert,
You subdued the heat with the shade of a cloud,
the rain of the tyrants was vanquished.
6
On this mountain
*
the L
ORD
of hosts
will provide for all peoples
A feast of rich food and choice wines,
juicy, rich food and pure, choice wines.
7
On this mountain he will destroy
the veil that veils all peoples,
The web that is woven over all nations.
8
He will destroy death forever.
The Lord G
OD
will wipe away
the tears from all faces;
The reproach of his people he will remove
from the whole earth; for the L
ORD
has spoken.
d
9
On that day it will be said:
“Indeed, this is our God; we looked to him, and he saved us!
This is the L
ORD
to whom we looked;
let us rejoice and be glad that he has saved us!”
e
Judgment on Moab
*
10
For the hand of the L
ORD
will rest on this mountain,
but Moab will be trodden down
as straw is trodden down in the mire.
f
11
He will spread out his hands in its midst,
as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim;
His pride will be brought low
despite his strokes.
g
12
The high-walled fortress he will raze,
bringing it low, leveling it to the ground, to the very dust.
