CHAPTER 5
Guilt of the Religious and Political Leaders
1
Hear this, priests,
Pay attention, house of Israel,
Household of the king, give ear!
a
For you are responsible for judgment.
*
But you have been a snare at Mizpah,
*
a net spread upon Tabor,
2
a pit dug deep in Shittim.
Now I will discipline them all.
3
I know Ephraim,
and Israel is not hidden from me:
Now, Ephraim, you have practiced prostitution,
Israel is defiled.
4
Their deeds do not allow them
to return to their God;
b
For the spirit of prostitution is in them,
and they do not know the L
ORD
.
5
The arrogance of Israel bears witness against him;
Israel and Ephraim stumble because of their iniquity,
and Judah stumbles with them.
6
With their flocks and herds they will go
to seek the L
ORD
, but will not find him;
c
he has withdrawn from them.
7
They have betrayed the L
ORD
,
for they have borne illegitimate children;
Now the new moon
*
will devour them
together with their fields.
Political Upheavals
*
8
Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah,
the trumpet in Ramah!
Sound the alarm in Beth-aven:
d
“Look behind you, Benjamin!”
*
9
Ephraim shall become a wasteland
on the day of punishment:
Among the tribes of Israel
I announce what is sure to be.
10
The princes of Judah have become
like those who move a boundary line;
*
e
Upon them I will pour out
my wrath like water.
11
Ephraim is oppressed, crushed by judgment,
for he has willingly gone after filth!
*
12
I am like a moth for Ephraim,
f
like rot for the house of Judah.
13
When Ephraim saw his infirmity,
and Judah his sore,
Ephraim went to Assyria,
and sent to the great king.
*
g
But he cannot heal you,
nor take away your sore.
14
For I am like a lion to Ephraim,
like a young lion to the house of Judah;
h
It is I who tear the prey and depart,
I carry it away and no one can save it.
i
Insincere Conversion
15
I will go back to my place
until they make reparation
and seek my presence.
In their affliction, they shall look for me.

* [
5:1
]
For you…judgment
: possibly “for you are called to judgment.”
* [
5:1
–
2
]
Mizpah
: several places bear this name; the best known is in Benjamin (
1 Sm 7:6
,
16
;
10:17
). Perhaps this is a wordplay on
mishpat
, “justice,” “judgment.”
Tabor
: the mountain that dominates the valley of Jezreel.
Shittim
: in Transjordan, where Israel committed its first act of idolatry with the Baal of Peor (
9:10
; cf.
Nm 25
). At these three places the leaders had misled the people by an idolatrous cult or by an abuse of justice.
* [
5:7
]
New moon
: normally a feast day of joy (
2:13
), but, because of infidelity, it will be a day of destruction.
* [
5:8
–
14
] This passage describes political and military conflict between Judah and Israel. Perhaps some allusion is made to the Syro-Ephraimite war of 735–734 B.C., when a coalition of Arameans and Israelites attempted to dethrone the king of Judah (
2 Kgs 16:5
;
Is 7:1
–
9
). Judah repulsed the attempt with the aid of Assyria, and the latter devastated both Aram and Israel.
* [
5:8
] A vision of invasion, from Gibeah and Ramah in northern Judah, into Israel.
* [
5:10
]
Move a boundary line
: invasion by Judah (v.
8
) is compared to a case of social injustice (
Dt 19:14
;
27:17
;
Prv 23:10
–
11
).
* [
5:11
]
Filth
: Ephraim’s reliance on foreign nations and their gods.
* [
5:13
]
Ephraim went…king
: in 738 the Israelite king Menahem had to pay tribute to the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III, whose vassal he became (
2 Kgs 15:19
–
20
). Under the threat of the Syro-Ephraimite invasion King Ahaz of Judah also submitted to Tiglath-pileser (
2 Kgs 16:7
–
9
).
Great king
: Heb.
melek-yarev
; may be a proper name: King Yarev, but unknown; or “the defender king”: irony about the great king of Assyria (see note on
10:6
).
