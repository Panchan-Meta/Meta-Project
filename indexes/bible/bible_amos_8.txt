CHAPTER 8
Fourth Vision: The Summer Fruit
1
This is what the Lord G
OD
showed me: a basket of end-of-summer fruit.
*
2
He asked, “What do you see, Amos?” And I answered, “A basket of end-of-summer fruit.” And the L
ORD
said to me:
The end has come for my people Israel;
I will forgive them no longer.
3
The temple singers will wail on that day—
oracle of the Lord G
OD
.
Many shall be the corpses,
strewn everywhere—Silence!
a
4
Hear this, you who trample upon the needy
and destroy the poor of the land:
5
“When will the new moon be over,” you ask,
“that we may sell our grain,
And the sabbath,
that we may open the grain-bins?
We will diminish the ephah,
*
add to the shekel,
and fix our scales for cheating!
b
6
We will buy the destitute for silver,
and the poor for a pair of sandals;
c
even the worthless grain we will sell!”
7
The L
ORD
has sworn by the pride of Jacob:
Never will I forget a thing they have done!
8
Shall not the land tremble because of this,
and all who dwell in it mourn?
It will all rise up and toss like the Nile,
and subside like the river of Egypt.
d
9
On that day—oracle of the Lord G
OD
—
I will make the sun set at midday
and in broad daylight cover the land with darkness.
10
I will turn your feasts into mourning
and all your songs into dirges.
I will cover the loins of all with sackcloth
and make every head bald.
I will make it like the time of mourning for an only child,
and its outcome like a day of bitter weeping.
e
11
See, days are coming—oracle of the Lord G
OD
—
when I will send a famine upon the land:
Not a hunger for bread, or a thirst for water,
but for hearing the word of the L
ORD
.
12
They shall stagger from sea to sea
and wander from north to east
In search of the word of the L
ORD
,
but they shall not find it.
f
13
On that day, beautiful young women and young men
shall faint from thirst,
14
Those who swear by Ashima of Samaria,
*
g
and who say, “By the life of your god, O Dan,”
“By the life of the Power of Beer-sheba!”
They shall fall, never to rise again.

End-of-summer fruit…the end has come

qayis
, while the word for “end” is
qes
.

Ephah
: see note on
