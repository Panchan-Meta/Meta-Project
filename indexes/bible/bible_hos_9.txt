CHAPTER 9
From Days of Celebration to Days of Punishment
1
Do not rejoice, Israel,
do not exult like the nations!
For you have prostituted yourself, abandoning your God,
loving a prostitute’s fee
upon every threshing floor.
*
2
Threshing floor and wine press will not nourish them,
the new wine will fail them.
3
They will not dwell in the L
ORD
’s land;
Ephraim will return to Egypt,
and in Assyria they will eat unclean food.
4
They will not pour libations of wine to the L
ORD
,
and their sacrifices will not please him.
Their bread will be like mourners’ bread,
*
a
that makes unclean all who eat of it;
Their food will be for their own appetites;
it cannot enter the house of the L
ORD
.
5
What will you do on the festival day,
the day of the L
ORD
’s feast?
*
6
*
When they flee from the devastation,
Egypt will gather them, Memphis will bury them.
Weeds will overgrow their silver treasures,
and thorns, their tents.
7
They have come, the days of punishment!
they have come, the days of recompense!
Let Israel know it!
“The prophet is a fool,
b
the man of the spirit is mad!”
Because your iniquity is great,
great, too, is your hostility.
8
*
The watchman of Ephraim, the people of my God, is the prophet;
c
yet a fowler’s snare is on all his ways,
hostility in the house of his God.
9
They have sunk to the depths of corruption,
as in the days of Gibeah;
*
d
God will remember their iniquity
and punish their sins.
From Former Glory to a History of Corruption
10
Like grapes in the desert,
I found Israel;
Like the first fruits of the fig tree, its first to ripen,
e
I looked on your ancestors.
But when they came to Baal-peor
*
f
and consecrated themselves to the Shameful One,
they became as abhorrent as the thing they loved.
11
Ephraim is like a bird:
their glory flies away—
no birth, no pregnancy, no conception.
g
12
Even though they bring up their children,
I will make them childless, until no one is left.
Indeed, woe to them
when I turn away from them!
13
Ephraim, as I saw, was a tree
planted in a meadow;
But now Ephraim will bring out
his children to the slaughterer!
14
Give them, L
ORD
!
give them what?
Give them a miscarrying womb,
and dry breasts!
h
15
All their misfortune began in Gilgal;
*
yes, there I rejected them.
Because of their wicked deeds
I will drive them out of my house.
I will love them no longer;
all their princes are rebels.
16
*
Ephraim is stricken,
their root is dried up;
i
they will bear no fruit.
j
Were they to bear children,
I would slay the beloved of their womb.
17
My God will disown them
because they have not listened to him;
they will be wanderers among the nations.
k
* [
9:1
]
Threshing floor
: an allusion to harvest festivals in honor of Baal, to whom the Israelites had attributed the fertility of the land; cf.
2:7
.
* [
9:4
]
Mourners’ bread
: bread eaten at funeral rites (
Dt 26:14
). The presence of a corpse also made all food prepared in that house unclean (
Jer 16:5
–
7
).
* [
9:5
]
The L
ORD
’s feast
: probably the important autumn feast of Booths, the most important of the Israelite public celebrations (
Lv 23:34
).
* [
9:6
] Instead of gathering for celebration (v.
5
), they will be gathered for death.
Memphis
: known for the monumental pyramid tombs.
Silver treasures
: the silver statues of Baal (
8:4
).
* [
9:8
] Prophets, like Hosea himself, are called to be sentinels for Israel, warning Israel of God’s coming wrath (see
Ez 3:17
;
33:7
), but often meet rejection.
* [
9:9
]
The days of Gibeah
: the precise allusion is not clear. Perhaps it is a reference to the outrage committed at Gibeah in the days of the judges (
Jgs 19
–
21
), or to questions surrounding Saul’s kingship at Gibeah (
1 Sm 10:26
;
14:2
;
22:6
).
* [
9:10
]
Baal-peor
: where the Israelites consecrated themselves for the first time to Baal (
Nm 25
; see note on
Hos 5:1
–
2
). Baal is here called the Shameful One.
* [
9:15
]
Gilgal
: possibly a reference to Saul’s disobedience to Samuel (
1 Sm 13:7
–
14
;
15
), or to the idolatry practiced in that place (see note on
Hos 4:15
).
* [
9:16
] Wordplay on the Hebrew word for “fruit” (
peri
) and Ephraim (see note on
8:9
). The whole passage (vv.
10
–
17
) presents a reversal of Ephraim’s name (
Gn 41:52
). He will have no fruit, a condition which will result in extinction.
