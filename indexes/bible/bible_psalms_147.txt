PSALM 147
*
God’s Word Restores Jerusalem
1
Hallelujah!
I
How good to sing praise to our God;
how pleasant to give fitting praise.
a
2
The L
ORD
rebuilds Jerusalem,
and gathers the dispersed of Israel,
b
3
Healing the brokenhearted,
and binding up their wounds.
c
4
He numbers the stars,
and gives to all of them their names.
d
5
Great is our Lord, vast in power,
with wisdom beyond measure.
e
6
The L
ORD
gives aid to the poor,
but casts the wicked to the ground.
f
II
7
Sing to the L
ORD
with thanksgiving;
with the lyre make music to our God,
g
8
*
Who covers the heavens with clouds,
provides rain for the earth,
makes grass sprout on the mountains,
h
9
Who gives animals their food
and young ravens what they cry for.
i
10
*
He takes no delight in the strength of horses,
no pleasure in the runner’s stride.
j
11
Rather the L
ORD
takes pleasure in those who fear him,
those who put their hope in his mercy.
III
12
Glorify the L
ORD
, Jerusalem;
Zion, offer praise to your God,
13
For he has strengthened the bars of your gates,
blessed your children within you.
k
14
He brings peace to your borders,
and satisfies you with finest wheat.
l
15
*
He sends his command to earth;
his word runs swiftly!
m
16
Thus he makes the snow like wool,
and spreads the frost like ash;
n
17
He disperses hail like crumbs.
Who can withstand his cold?
18
Yet when again he issues his command, it melts them;
he raises his winds and the waters flow.
19
He proclaims his word to Jacob,
his statutes and laws to Israel.
o
20
He has not done this for any other nation;
of such laws they know nothing.
Hallelujah!
* [
Psalm 147
] The hymn is divided into three sections by the calls to praise in
Ps 147:1
,
7
,
12
. The first section praises the powerful creator who restores exiled Judah (
Ps 147:1
–
6
); the second section, the creator who provides food to animals and human beings; the third and climactic section exhorts the holy city to recognize it has been re-created and made the place of disclosure for God’s word, a word as life-giving as water.
* [
147:8
–
9
] God clothes the fields and feeds the birds, cf.
Mt 6:26
,
30
.
* [
147:10
–
11
] Acknowledging one’s dependence upon God rather than claiming self-sufficiency pleases God, cf.
Ps 20:8
;
33:16
–
19
.
* [
147:15
–
19
] God speaks through the thunder of nature and the word of revealed law, cf.
Is 55:10
–
11
. The weather phenomena are well known in Jerusalem: a blizzard of snow and hail followed by a thunderstorm that melts the ice.
