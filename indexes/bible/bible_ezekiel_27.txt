CHAPTER 27
The Ship Tyre.
1
The word of the L
ORD
came to me:
2
You, son of man, raise a lament over Tyre,
3
and say to Tyre, who sits at the entrance to the sea, trader to peoples on many coastlands, Thus says the Lord G
OD
:
Tyre, you said, “I am a ship,
perfect in beauty”;
a
4
In the heart of the sea was your territory;
your builders perfected your beauty.
b
5
With juniper wood from Senir
*
they built all your decks;
A cedar from Lebanon they took
to make you a mast.
6
With oaks of Bashan
*
they fashioned your oars,
Your bridge, of ivory-inlaid cypress wood
from the coasts of Kittim.
7
Fine embroidered linen from Egypt
became your sail;
Your awnings were made of purple and scarlet
from the coasts of Elishah.
*
c
8
Inhabitants of Sidon
*
and Arvad
were your oarsmen;
Your own sages, Tyre, were on board,
serving as your sailors.
d
9
The elders and sages of Gebal
were with you to caulk your seams.
Every ship and sailor on the sea
came to you to carry on trade.
e
10
Persia and Lud and Put
were warriors in your army;
Shield and helmet they hung on you
to enhance your splendor.
11
The men of Arvad and Helech
*
were on your walls all around
And Gamadites on your towers;
they hung their shields around your walls,
they made your beauty perfect.
12
Tarshish traded with you,
so great was your wealth,
Exchanging for your wares
silver, iron, tin, and lead.
13
Javan, Tubal, and Meshech
also traded with you,
Exchanging slaves and bronze vessels
for your merchandise.
f
14
Horses, steeds, and mules from Beth-togarmah
were exchanged for your wares.
15
Men of Rhodes trafficked with you;
many coastlands were your agents;
Ivory tusks and ebony wood
they brought back as your payment.
16
Edom traded with you for your many wares:
garnets, purple dye, embroidered cloth,
Fine linen, coral, and rubies
they gave you as merchandise.
17
Judah and the land of Israel
trafficked with you:
Minnith wheat, grain,
*
honey, oil, and balm
g
they gave you as merchandise.
18
Damascus traded with you for your many wares,
so great was your wealth,
exchanging Helbon wine and Zahar wool.
19
Javan exchanged wrought iron, cassia, and aromatic cane
from Uzal for your wares.
20
Dedan traded with you for riding gear.
h
21
Arabia and the sheikhs of Kedar were your agents,
dealing in lambs, rams, and goats.
i
22
The merchants of Sheba and Raamah also traded with you,
exchanging for your wares the very best spices,
all kinds of precious stones, and gold.
23
Haran, Canneh, and Eden,
the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad,
24
Traded with you, marketing rich garments,
purple cloth, embroidered fabric,
varicolored carpets, and braided cords.
25
The ships of Tarshish sailed for you with your goods;
You were full and heavily laden
in the heart of the sea.
26
Out into deep waters
your oarsmen brought you;
The east wind shattered you
in the heart of the sea.
j
27
Your wealth, your goods, your wares,
your sailors, your crew,
The caulkers of your seams,
those who traded for your goods,
All the warriors with you,
the whole crowd with you
Sank into the heart of the sea
on the day of your downfall.
k
28
At the sound of your sailors’ shouts
the waves shudder,
l
29
Down from their ships
come all who ply the oars;
Sailors, all the seafaring crew,
stand on the shore.
30
They raise their voices over you
and shout their bitter cries;
They pour dust on their heads
and cover themselves with ashes.
31
For you they shave their heads bald
and put on sackcloth;
For you they weep bitterly,
in anguished lament.
m
32
They raise a lament for you;
they wail over you:
“Who was ever destroyed like Tyre
in the midst of the sea?”
n
33
By exporting your goods by sea
you satisfied many peoples,
With your great wealth and merchandise
you enriched the kings of the earth.
o
34
Now you are wrecked in the sea,
in the watery depths;
Your wares and all your crew
have fallen down with you.
35
All who dwell on the coastlands
are aghast over you;
Their kings are terrified,
their faces distorted.
36
The traders among the peoples
now hiss at you;
You have become a horror,
you shall be no more.
