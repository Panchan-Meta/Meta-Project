PSALM 145
*
The Greatness and Goodness of God
1
Praise. Of David.
I will extol you, my God and king;
I will bless your name forever and ever.
2
Every day I will bless you;
I will praise your name forever and ever.
a
3
Great is the L
ORD
and worthy of much praise,
b
whose grandeur is beyond understanding.
4
One generation praises your deeds to the next
and proclaims your mighty works.
c
5
They speak of the splendor of your majestic glory,
tell of your wonderful deeds.
d
6
They speak of the power of your awesome acts
and recount your great deeds.
e
7
They celebrate your abounding goodness
and joyfully sing of your justice.
8
The L
ORD
is gracious and merciful,
slow to anger and abounding in mercy.
f
9
The L
ORD
is good to all,
compassionate toward all your works.
g
10
All your works give you thanks, L
ORD
and your faithful bless you.
h
11
They speak of the glory of your reign
and tell of your mighty works,
12
Making known to the sons of men your mighty acts,
the majestic glory of your rule.
13
Your reign is a reign for all ages,
your dominion for all generations.
i
The L
ORD
is trustworthy in all his words,
and loving in all his works.
14
The L
ORD
supports all who are falling
and raises up all who are bowed down.
j
15
The eyes of all look hopefully to you;
you give them their food in due season.
k
16
You open wide your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
17
The L
ORD
is just in all his ways,
merciful in all his works.
l
18
The L
ORD
is near to all who call upon him,
to all who call upon him in truth.
m
19
He fulfills the desire of those who fear him;
he hears their cry and saves them.
n
20
The L
ORD
watches over all who love him,
but all the wicked he destroys.
o
21
My mouth will speak the praises of the L
ORD
;
all flesh will bless his holy name forever and ever.

Psalm 145
] A hymn in acrostic form; every verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Acrostic poems usually do not develop ideas but consist rather of loosely connected statements. The singer invites all to praise God (
Ps 145:1
–
3
,
21
). The “works of God” make God present and invite human praise (
Ps 145:4
–
7
); they climax in a confession (
Ps 145:8
–
9
). God’s mighty acts show forth divine kingship (
Ps 145:10
–
20
), a major theme in the literature of early Judaism and in Christianity.
