CHAPTER 3
The Day of the Lord
a

*
It shall come to pass
I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
Your sons and daughters will prophesy,
your old men will dream dreams,
your young men will see visions.
2
Even upon your male and female servants,
in those days, I will pour out my spirit.
3
I will set signs in the heavens and on the earth,
blood, fire, and columns of smoke;
4
The sun will darken,
the moon turn blood-red,
Before the day of the L
ORD
arrives,
that great and terrible day.
b
5
Then everyone who calls upon the name of the L
ORD
will escape harm.
For on Mount Zion there will be a remnant,
as the L
ORD
has said,
And in Jerusalem survivors
whom the L
ORD
will summon.

] In many places in the Old Testament, Hebrew
ruah
is God’s power, or spirit, bestowed on chosen individuals. The word can also mean “breath” or “wind.” In this summary introduction to his second speech, Joel anticipates that the Lord will someday renew faithful Judahites with the divine spirit. In
Acts 2:17

the author has Peter cite Joel’s words to suggest that the newly constituted Christian community, filled with divine life and power, inaugurates the Lord’s Day, understood as salvation for all who believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ.
