PSALM 140
*
Prayer for Deliverance from the Wicked
1
For the leader. A psalm of David.
I
2
Deliver me, L
ORD
, from the wicked;
preserve me from the violent,
a
3
From those who plan evil in their hearts,
who stir up conflicts every day,
4
*
Who sharpen their tongue like a serpent,
venom of asps upon their lips.
b
Selah
II
5
Keep me, L
ORD
, from the clutches of the wicked;
preserve me from the violent,
who plot to trip me up.
c
6
*
The arrogant have set a trap for me;
they have spread out ropes for a net,
laid snares for me by the wayside.
Selah
7
I say to the L
ORD
: You are my God;
d
listen, L
ORD
, to the words of my pleas.
8
L
ORD
, my master, my strong deliverer,
you cover my head on the day of armed conflict.
9
L
ORD
, do not grant the desires of the wicked one;
do not let his plot succeed.
Selah
III
10
Those who surround me raise their heads;
may the mischief they threaten overwhelm them.
11
Drop burning coals upon them;
e
cast them into the watery pit never more to rise.
12
Slanderers will not survive on earth;
evil will hunt down the man of violence to overthrow him.
13
For I know the L
ORD
will take up the cause of the needy,
justice for the poor.
14
Then the righteous will give thanks to your name;
the upright will dwell in your presence.

* [
Psalm 140
] A lament seeking rescue from violent and treacherous foes (
Ps 140:2
–
6
). The psalmist remains trusting (
Ps 140:7
–
8
), vigorously praying that the plans of the wicked recoil upon themselves (
Ps 140:9
–
12
). A serene statement of praise ends the Psalm (
Ps 140:13
). The psalmist is content to be known as one of “the needy,” “the poor,” “the just,” “the upright” (
Ps 140:13
), a class of people expecting divine protection.
* [
140:4

Ps 52:2
;
55:20
;
58:3
.
