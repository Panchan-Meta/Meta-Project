PSALM 149
*
Praise God with Song and Sword
1
Hallelujah!
Sing to the L
ORD
a new song,
his praise in the assembly of the faithful.
a
2
Let Israel be glad in its maker,
the people of Zion rejoice in their king.
3
Let them praise his name in dance,
make music with tambourine and lyre.
*
b
4
For the L
ORD
takes delight in his people,
honors the poor with victory.
5
Let the faithful rejoice in their glory,
cry out for joy on their couches,
*
6
With the praise of God in their mouths,
and a two-edged sword in their hands,
c
7
To bring retribution on the nations,
punishment on the peoples,
d
8
To bind their kings in shackles,
their nobles in chains of iron,
9
To execute the judgments decreed for them—
such is the glory
*
of all God’s faithful.
Hallelujah!
* [
Psalm 149
] A hymn inviting the people of Israel to celebrate their God in song and festive dance (
Ps 149:1
–
3
,
5
) because God has chosen them and given them victory (
Ps 149:4
). The exodus and conquest are the defining acts of Israel; the people must be ready to do again those acts in the future at the divine command (
Ps 149:6
–
9
).
* [
149:3
]
Make music with tambourine and lyre
: the verse recalls the great exodus hymn of
Ex 15:20
.
* [
149:5
]
On their couches
: the people reclined to banquet.
* [
149:9
]
The glory
: what brings honor to the people is their readiness to carry out the divine will, here conceived as punishing injustice done by the nations.
