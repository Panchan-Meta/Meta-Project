CHAPTER 34
Josiah’s Reforms.
1
a
Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
2
He did what was right in the L
ORD
’s sight, walking in the way of David his father, not turning right or left.
3
b
In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a youth, he began to seek after the God of David his father. Then in his twelfth year
*
he began to purify Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the asherahs, and the carved and molten images.
4
In his presence, the altars of the Baals were torn down; the incense stands erected above them he broke down; the asherahs and the carved and molten images he smashed and beat into dust, which he scattered over the tombs of those who had sacrificed to them;
5
and the bones of the priests he burned upon their altars. Thus he purified Judah and Jerusalem.
6
He did likewise in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and in the ruined villages of the surrounding country as far as Naphtali;
7
he tore down the altars and asherahs, and the carved images he beat into dust, and broke down the incense stands throughout the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
The Temple Restored.
8
c
In the eighteenth year of his reign, in order to purify the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan, son of Azaliah, Maaseiah, the ruler of the city, and Joah, son of Joahaz, the chancellor, to restore the house of the L
ORD
, his God.
9
They came to Hilkiah the high priest and turned over the money brought to the house of God which the Levites, the guardians of the threshold, had collected from Manasseh, Ephraim, and all the remnant of Israel, as well as from all of Judah, Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
d
10
They turned it over to the master workers in the house of the L
ORD
, and these in turn used it to pay the workers in the L
ORD
’s house who were restoring and repairing it.
11
They also gave it to the carpenters and the masons to buy hewn stone and timber for the tie beams and rafters of the buildings which the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.
12
The men worked faithfully at their task; their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites of the line of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the Kohathites, who directed them. All those Levites who were skillful with musical instruments
13
were in charge of the men who carried the burdens, and they directed all the workers in every kind of labor. Some of the other Levites were scribes, officials, and gatekeepers.
The Finding of the Law.
14
e
When they brought out the money that had been deposited in the house of the L
ORD
, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the L
ORD
given through Moses.
15
He reported this to Shaphan the scribe, saying, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the L
ORD
.” Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan,
16
who brought it to the king at the same time that he made his report to him. He said, “Your servants are doing everything that has been entrusted to them;
17
they have smelted down the silver deposited in the L
ORD
’s house and have turned it over to the overseers and the workers.”
18
Then Shaphan the scribe also informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book,” and then Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
19
When the king heard the words of the law, he tore his garments.
20
The king then issued this command to Hilkiah, to Ahikam, son of Shaphan, to Abdon, son of Michah, to Shaphan the scribe, and to Asaiah, the king’s servant:
21
“Go, consult the L
ORD
for me and for those who are left in Israel and Judah, about the words of the book that has been found, for the anger of the L
ORD
burns furiously against us, because our ancestors did not keep the word of the L
ORD
and have not done all that is written in this book.”
22
Then Hilkiah and others from the king went to Huldah the prophet, wife of Shallum, son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; she lived in Jerusalem, in the Second Quarter. They spoke to her as they had been instructed,
23
and she said to them: “Thus says the L
ORD
, the God of Israel: Say to the man who sent you to me,
24
Thus says the L
ORD
: I am about to bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses written in the book that was read before the king of Judah.
25
Because they have abandoned me and have burned incense to other gods, provoking me by all the works of their hands, my anger burns against this place and it cannot be extinguished.
26
“But to the king of Judah who sent you to consult the L
ORD
, give this response: Thus says the L
ORD
, the God of Israel: As for the words you have heard,
27
because you were heartsick and have humbled yourself before God when you heard his words concerning this place and its inhabitants; because you humbled yourself before me, tore your garments, and wept before me, I in turn have heard—oracle of the L
ORD
.
28
I will gather you to your ancestors and you shall go to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil I am about to bring upon this place and upon its inhabitants.”
This they reported to the king.
Covenant Renewal.
29
f
The king then had all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem summoned before him.
30
The king went up to the house of the L
ORD
with all the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: priests, Levites, and all the people, great and small. He read aloud to them all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the L
ORD
.
31
The king stood by the column
*
and made a covenant in the presence of the L
ORD
to follow the L
ORD
and to observe his commandments, statutes, and decrees with his whole heart and soul, carrying out the words of the covenant written in this book.
32
He thereby committed all who were in Jerusalem and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted according to the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.
33
Josiah removed every abomination from all the territories belonging to the Israelites, and he obliged all who were in Israel to serve the L
ORD
, their God. During his lifetime they did not turn away from following the L
ORD
, the God of their ancestors.

In his twelfth year
: ca. 628 B.C., i.e., around the time of the Assyrian emperor Asshurbanipal’s death, which enabled Judah to free itself from Assyrian domination. On the basis of
2 Kgs 22:1
–
23:25
alone, one might suppose that Josiah’s reform began only after and as a result of the discovery of the book of the law in the Temple, in the eighteenth year of his reign (622 B.C.). But the Chronicler is no doubt right in placing the beginning of the reform at an earlier period. The repair of the Temple itself, which led to the finding of the book of the law, was likely part of a cultic reform initiated by Josiah.
