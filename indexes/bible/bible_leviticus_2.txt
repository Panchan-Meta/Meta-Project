CHAPTER 2
Grain Offerings.
1
*
a
When anyone brings a grain offering to the L
ORD
, the offering must consist of bran flour. The offerer shall pour oil on it and put frankincense
b
over it,
2
and bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests. A priest shall take a handful of the bran flour and oil, together with all the frankincense, and shall burn it on the altar as a token of the offering,
*
a sweet-smelling oblation to the L
ORD
.
c
3
The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons,
d
a most holy
e
portion from the oblations to the L
ORD
.
4
When you offer a grain offering baked in an oven, it must be in the form of unleavened cakes made of bran flour mixed with oil, or of unleavened wafers spread with oil.
f
5
If your offering is a grain offering that is fried on a griddle,
g
it must be of bran flour mixed with oil and unleavened.
6
Break it into pieces, and pour oil over it. It is a grain offering.
7
If your offering is a grain offering that is prepared in a pan, it must be made of bran flour, fried in oil.
8
A grain offering that is made in any of these ways you shall bring to the L
ORD
. It shall be presented to the priest, who shall take it to the altar.
9
The priest shall then remove from the grain offering a token and burn it on the altar as a sweet-smelling oblation to the L
ORD
.
10
The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons, a most holy portion from the oblations to the L
ORD
.
11
*
Every grain offering that you present to the L
ORD
shall be unleavened, for you shall not burn any leaven or honey as an oblation to the L
ORD
.
h
12
Such you may present to the L
ORD
in the offering of the first produce that is processed,
i
but they are not to be placed on the altar for a pleasing odor.
13
You shall season all your grain offerings with salt. Do not let the salt of the covenant with your God
*
be lacking from your grain offering. On every offering you shall offer salt.
j
14
If you offer a grain offering of first ripe fruits to the L
ORD
, you shall offer it in the form of fresh early grain, roasted by fire and crushed as a grain offering of your first ripe fruits.
15
You shall put oil on it and set frankincense on it. It is a grain offering.
16
The priest shall then burn some of the groats and oil, together with all the frankincense, as a token of the offering, an oblation to the L
ORD
.
* [
2:1
] Grain offerings are used as independent offerings (those in this chapter and cf.
6:12
–
16
;
8:26
–
27
;
23:10
–
11
), as substitutes for other offerings in a case of poverty (
5:11
–
13
), and as accompaniments to animal offerings (cf.
Nm 15:1
–
12
;
28:1
–
29:39
;
Lv 14:20
;
23:12
,
18
,
37
). Chapter
2
describes two basic types of grain offering: uncooked (vv.
1
–
3
) and cooked (vv.
4
–
10
). The flour (
sōlet
) used was made of wheat (
Ex 29:2
) and Jewish tradition and Semitic cognates indicate that it is a coarse rather than a fine flour.
* [
2:2
]
Token of the offering
: lit., “reminder.” Instead of burning the whole grain offering, only this part is burned on the altar.
* [
2:11
–
12
] No grain offering that is leavened can be offered on the altar. Those in
7:13
and
23:17
are leavened but not offered on the altar. The Hebrew word for “honey” may refer to fruit syrup as well as to bee honey.
* [
2:13
]
The salt of the covenant with your God
: partaking of salt in common was an ancient symbol of friendship and alliance. Cf.
Mark 9:49
–
50
and
Col 4:6
