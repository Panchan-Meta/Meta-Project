CHAPTER 5
The Community’s Lament to the Lord
1
Remember, L
ORD
, what has happened to us,
pay attention, and see our disgrace:
2
Our heritage is turned over to strangers,
our homes, to foreigners.
a
3
We have become orphans, without fathers;
our mothers are like widows.
4
We pay money to drink our own water,
our own wood comes at a price.
5
With a yoke on our necks, we are driven;
we are worn out, but allowed no rest.
6
We extended a hand to Egypt and Assyria,
to satisfy our need of bread.
*
7
Our ancestors, who sinned, are no more;
but now we bear their guilt.
8
Servants
*
rule over us,
with no one to tear us from their hands.
9
We risk our lives just to get bread,
exposed to the desert heat;
b
10
Our skin heats up like an oven,
from the searing blasts of famine.
c
11
Women are raped in Zion,
young women in the cities of Judah;
d
12
Princes have been hanged by them,
elders shown no respect.
e
13
Young men carry millstones,
boys stagger under loads of wood;
14
The elders have abandoned the gate,
*
the young men their music.
15
The joy of our hearts has ceased,
dancing has turned into mourning;
f
16
The crown has fallen from our head:
woe to us that we sinned!
17
Because of this our hearts grow sick,
at this our eyes grow dim:
18
Because of Mount Zion, lying desolate,
and the jackals roaming there!
19
But you, L
ORD
, are enthroned forever;
your throne stands from age to age.
g
20
*
Why have you utterly forgotten us,
forsaken us for so long?
h
21
Bring us back to you, L
ORD
, that we may return:
renew our days as of old.
i
22
For now you have indeed rejected us
and utterly turned your wrath against us.

* [
5:6
]
Extended a hand
: that is, made an alliance. In its state of abjection, Judah was forced to depend on the major powers to the west and the east for subsistence.
* [
5:8
]
Servants
: the Hebrew word for “servant” is also the word used for an official of relatively high status (servant of the ruler; cf.
2 Kgs 25:24
, where the term is used to refer to Babylonian rulers over occupied Jerusalem); the author doubtless intends the double meaning here.
* [
5:14
]
The gate
: a place of assembly, where city decisions were made and judgment given by the elders and other community leaders; see note on
Ru 4:1
.
* [
5:20
–
22
] Unlike most of the laments found in the Book of Psalms, the Book of Lamentations never moves from lament to thanksgiving. It ends with this question still unanswered by God: “Why have you utterly forgotten us?”
