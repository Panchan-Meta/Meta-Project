CHAPTER 29

but it is from the L
ORD

* [
29:1
] The idiom “to stiffen one’s neck” occurs in a context of not heeding a message in
Dt 10:16
and
2 Kgs 17:14
. To stiffen one’s neck in this sense risks having it broken, as in
1 Sm 4:18
.
* [
29:2
] Popular response to a just or unjust ruler is expressed in sound—shouts of joy or groans of anguish. “Rejoice” can mean to express one’s joy, i.e., joyous shouts.
* [
29:4
] In Hebrew as in English high and low are metaphors for prosperity and depression. A king who is just “causes the land to stand up,” i.e., to be prosperous, and one who makes taxes high brings a country low.
* [
29:5
] When one addresses deceptive words to someone’s face, one equivalently throws a net at their feet to snare them.
* [
29:7
] As in
12:10
(on care for animals), the righteous care for those who are without a voice and often treated like animals. Colon B has a double meaning: the wicked have no such knowledge (care for the poor) and they have no knowledge (wisdom), for they are fools.
* [
29:10
] An enigmatic saying in that “seek one’s life” is a common idiom for killing. The saying probably plays on the idiom, interpreting “to seek the life of another” not as killing but as caring for another (as in
11:30
).
* [
29:16
] When the wicked grow numerous they sow the seeds of their own destruction, for there is a corresponding increase in offenses calling down divine retribution.
* [
29:18
] This much-cited proverb has been interpreted in several different ways. “Vision” and “instruction” mean authoritative guidance for the community. People are demoralized without credible leadership, but any individual heeding traditional instruction can still find happiness. As in
15:15
wisdom enables an individual to surmount days of trouble.
* [
29:19
] The give and take of reproving is not possible for servants or slaves. Ancient custom dictated silent acquiescence for them. There is no open and free dialogue, which is part of ancient discipline.
* [
29:23
] One’s prideful height brings one down and one’s lowly state brings glory.
* [
29:24
]
Hate themselves
: because they not only incur guilt as accomplices but, by their silence, bring down on themselves the curse invoked on the unknown guilty partner. Such a case is envisioned in
Lv 5:1
. After a theft, a public proclamation was made, enforced by a curse. No one in a town or city could avoid hearing it. The curse hung over the accomplice. By doing nothing, neither directly stealing nor confessing, accomplices put themselves in serious danger.
