PSALM 120
*
Prayer of a Returned Exile
1
A song of ascents.
*
The L
ORD
answered me
when I called in my distress:
a
2
L
ORD
, deliver my soul from lying lips,
from a treacherous tongue.
b
3
What will he inflict on you,
O treacherous tongue,
and what more besides?
*
4
A warrior’s arrows
sharpened with coals of brush wood!
*
c
5
*
Alas, I am a foreigner in Meshech,
I live among the tents of Kedar!
6
Too long do I live
among those who hate peace.
7
When I speak of peace,
they are for war.
d
* [
Psalm 120
] A thanksgiving, reporting divine rescue (
Ps 120:1
) yet with fervent prayer for further protection against lying attackers (
Ps 120:2
–
4
). The psalmist is acutely conscious of living away from God’s own land where divine peace prevails (
Ps 120:5
–
7
).
* [
120:1
]
A song of ascents
:
Ps 120
–
134
all begin with this superscription. Most probably these fifteen Psalms once formed a collection of Psalms sung when pilgrims went to Jerusalem, since one “ascended” to Jerusalem (
1 Kgs 12:28
;
Ps 24:3
;
122:4
;
Lk 2:42
) or to the house of God or to an altar (
1 Kgs 12:33
;
2 Kgs 23:2
;
Ps 24:3
). Less probable is the explanation that these Psalms were sung by the exiles when they “ascended” to Jerusalem from Babylonia (cf.
Ezr 7:9
). The idea, found in the Mishnah, that the fifteen steps on which the Levites sang corresponded to these fifteen Psalms (Middot 2:5) must underlie the Vulgate translation
canticum graduum
, “song of the steps” or “gradual song.”
* [
120:3
]
More besides
: a common curse formula in Hebrew was “May the Lord do such and such evils to you [the evils being specified], and add still more to them,” cf.
1 Sm 3:17
;
14:44
;
25:22
. Here the psalmist is at a loss for a suitable malediction.
* [
120:4
]
Coals of brush wood
: coals made from the stalk of the broom plant burn with intense heat. The psalmist thinks of lighted coals cast at his enemies.
* [
120:5
] Meshech was in the far north (
Gn 10:2
) and Kedar was a tribe of the north Arabian desert (
Gn 25:13
). The psalmist may be thinking generally of all aliens living among inhospitable peoples.
