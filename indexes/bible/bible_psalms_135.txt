PSALM 135
*
Praise of God, the Ruler and Benefactor of Israel
1
Hallelujah!
I
Praise the name of the L
ORD
!
Praise, you servants of the L
ORD
,
a
2
Who stand in the house of the L
ORD
,
in the courts of the house of our God!
b
3
Praise the L
ORD
, for the L
ORD
is good!
Sing to his name, for it brings joy!
4
*
For the L
ORD
has chosen Jacob for himself,
Israel as his treasured possession.
c
II
5
For I know that the L
ORD
is great,
that our Lord is greater than all gods.
d
6
Whatever the L
ORD
desires
he does in heaven and on earth,
in the seas and all the depths.
e
7
It is he who raises storm clouds from the end of the earth,
makes lightning for the rain,
and brings forth wind from his storehouse.
f
III
8
He struck down Egypt’s firstborn,
g
of human being and beast alike,
9
And sent signs and wonders against you, Egypt,
against Pharaoh and all his servants.
10
It is he who struck down many nations,
h
and slew mighty kings—
11
Sihon, king of the Amorites,
and Og, king of Bashan,
all the kings of Canaan—
12
And made their land a heritage,
a heritage for Israel his people.
13
O L
ORD
, your name is forever,
your renown, from generation to generation!
i
14
For the L
ORD
defends his people,
shows mercy to his servants.
j
IV
15
The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
k
the work of human hands.
16
They have mouths but do not speak;
they have eyes but do not see;
17
They have ears but do not hear;
nor is there breath in their mouths.
18
Their makers will become like them,
and anyone who trusts in them.
V
19
House of Israel, bless the L
ORD
!
l
House of Aaron, bless the L
ORD
!
20
House of Levi, bless the L
ORD
!
You who fear the L
ORD
, bless the L
ORD
!
21
Blessed be the L
ORD
from Zion,
who dwells in Jerusalem!
Hallelujah!

Psalm 135
] The hymn begins and ends with an invitation to praise God (
Ps 135:1
–
3
,
19
–
20
) for the great act of choosing Israel (
Ps 135:4
). The story of Israel’s emergence as a people is told in
Ps 135:5
–
14
; God created and redeemed the people, easily conquering all opposition. God’s defeat of hostile powers means that the powers themselves and their images are useless (
Ps 135:15
–
18
). The last three verses appear also in
Ps 115:4
–
8
.
