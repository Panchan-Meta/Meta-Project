CHAPTER 15
Boundaries of Judah.
1
The lot for the tribe of Judah by their clans fell toward the boundary of Edom, the wilderness of Zin in the Negeb, in the extreme south.
a
2
b
Their southern boundary ran from the end of the Salt Sea,
*
from the tongue of land that faces the Negeb,
3
and went southward below the pass of Akrabbim, across through Zin, up to a point south of Kadesh-barnea, across to Hezron, and up to Addar; from there, looping around Karka,
4
it crossed to Azmon and then joined the Wadi of Egypt
*
before coming out at the sea. (This is your southern boundary.)
5
The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan.
The northern boundary climbed northward from the tongue of the sea, toward the mouth of the Jordan,
6
c
up to Beth-hoglah, and ran north of Beth-arabah, up to Eben-Bohan-ben-Reuben.
7
Thence the boundary climbed to Debir, north of the Valley of Achor,
d
in the direction of the Gilgal that faces the pass of Adummim, on the south side of the wadi; from there it crossed to the waters of En-shemesh and emerged at En-rogel.
8
Climbing again to the Valley of Ben-hinnom
*
on the southern flank of the Jebusites (that is, Jerusalem), the boundary rose to the top of the mountain at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim,
e
which bounds the Valley of Hinnom on the west.
9
From the top of the mountain it ran to the fountain of waters of Nephtoah,
f
extended to the cities of Mount Ephron, and continued to Baalah, or Kiriath-jearim.
10
From Baalah the boundary curved westward to Mount Seir and passed north of the ridge of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon); it descended to Beth-shemesh, and ran across to Timnah.
11
It then extended along the northern flank of Ekron, continued through Shikkeron, and across to Mount Baalah, from there to include Jabneel, before it came out at the sea.
12
The western boundary was the Great Sea
*
and its coast. This was the complete boundary of the Judahites by their clans.
Conquest by Caleb.
13
g
As the L
ORD
had commanded, Joshua gave Caleb, son of Jephunneh,
h
a portion among the Judahites, namely, Kiriath-arba (Arba was the father of Anak), that is, Hebron.
14
i
And Caleb dispossessed from there the three Anakim, the descendants of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
15
From there he marched up against the inhabitants of Debir,
j
which was formerly called Kiriath-sepher.
16
Caleb said, “To the man who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage.”
17
*
Othniel captured it, the son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz; so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage.
18
When she came to him, she induced him to ask her father for some land. Then, as she alighted from the donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want?”
19
She answered, “Give me a present! Since you have assigned to me land in the Negeb, give me also pools of water.” So he gave her the upper and the lower pools.

62
Nibshan, Ir-hamelah, and En-gedi; six cities and their villages.

But the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem the Judahites could not dispossess; so the Jebusites dwell in Jerusalem beside the Judahites to the present day.

Salt Sea
: the Dead Sea. The “tongue,” a prominent feature of the landscape, is a spit of land thrusting into the Dead Sea from its eastern shore; it is now called by its Arabic name,
’el lisân
, “tongue.”
* [
15:4
]
Wadi of Egypt
: the natural boundary between Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula.
* [
15:8
]
The Valley of Ben-hinnom
: the southern limit of Jerusalem.
Ben-hinnom
means “son of Hinnom.” The place was also called Valley of Hinnom, in Hebrew
ge-hinnom
, whence the word “Gehenna” is derived.
* [
15:12
]
Great Sea
: the Mediterranean.
* [

Jgs 1:13
–

; cf. also
Jgs 3:9
–

.
* [
15:20
–
62
] This elaborate list of the cities of Judah was probably taken from a document made originally for administrative purposes; the cities are divided into four provincial districts, some of which have further subdivisions. For similar lists of the cities of Judah, cf.
19:2
–
7
;
1 Chr 4:28
–
32
;
Neh 11:25
–
30
. This list has suffered in transmission, so that the totals given in vv.
32
and
36
are not exact; many of the cities cannot be identified.
