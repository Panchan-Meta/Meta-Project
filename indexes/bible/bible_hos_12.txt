CHAPTER 12
Infidelity of Israel
*
1
Ephraim has surrounded me with lies,
the house of Israel, with deceit;
Judah still wanders about with gods,
and is faithful to holy ones.
*
2
*
Ephraim shepherds the wind,
and pursues the east wind all day long.
He multiplies lies and violence:
They make a covenant with Assyria,
and oil is carried to Egypt.
3
The L
ORD
has a dispute with Judah,
and will punish Jacob
*
for his conduct,
and repay him for his deeds.
4
In the womb he supplanted his brother,
a
and in his vigor he contended with a divine being;
5
He contended with an angel and prevailed,
b
he wept and entreated him.
At Bethel he met with him,
and there he spoke with him.
c
6
The L
ORD
is the God of hosts,
the L
ORD
is his name!
d
7
You must return to your God.
Maintain loyalty and justice
and always hope in your God.
8
A merchant who holds a false balance,
he loves to extort!
9
Ephraim has said,
“How rich I have become;
I have made a fortune!”
e
All his gain will not suffice
for the guilt of his sin.
10
I the L
ORD
have been your God,
since the land of Egypt;
f
I will again have you live in tents,
as on feast days.
11
I spoke to the prophets,
I granted many visions,
g
and through the prophets I told parables.
12
In Gilead is falsehood, they have come to nothing;
in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls,
But their altars are like heaps of stones
h
in the furrows of the field.
13
Jacob fled to the land of Aram,
and Israel served for a wife;
for a wife he tended sheep.
i
14
But by a prophet
*
the L
ORD
brought Israel out of Egypt,
and by a prophet Israel was tended.
j
15
Ephraim has aroused bitter anger,
so his Lord shall cast his bloodguilt upon him
and repay him for his scorn.
