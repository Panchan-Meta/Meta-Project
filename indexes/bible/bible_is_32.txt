CHAPTER 32
The Kingdom of Justice
1
See, a king will reign justly
and princes will rule rightly.
a
2
Each of them will be like a shelter from the wind,
a refuge from the rain.
They will be like streams of water in a dry country,
like the shade of a great rock in a parched land.
b
3
The eyes of those who see will not be closed;
the ears of those who hear will be attentive.
c
4
The hasty of heart shall take thought to know,
and tongues of stutterers shall speak readily and clearly.
5
No more will the fool be called noble,
nor the deceiver be considered honorable.
d
6
For the fool speaks folly,
his heart plans evil:
Godless actions,
perverse speech against the L
ORD
,
Letting the hungry go empty
and the thirsty without drink.
e
7
The deceits of the deceiver are evil,
he plans devious schemes:
To ruin the poor with lies,
and the needy when they plead their case.
f
8
But the noble plan noble deeds,
and in noble deeds they persist.
The Women of Jerusalem
9
You women so complacent, rise up and hear my voice,
daughters so confident, give heed to my words.
g
10
In a little more than a year
your confidence will be shaken;
For the vintage will fail,
no fruit harvest will come in.
h
11
Tremble, you who are so complacent!
Shudder, you who are so confident!
Strip yourselves bare,
with only a loincloth for cover.
i
12
Beat your breasts
for the pleasant fields,
for the fruitful vine;
j
13
For the soil of my people,
overgrown with thorns and briers;
For all the joyful houses,
the exultant city.
k
14
The castle
*
will be forsaken,
the noisy city deserted;
Citadel and tower will become wasteland forever,
the joy of wild donkeys, the pasture of flocks;
l
15
*
Until the spirit from on high
is poured out on us.
And the wilderness becomes a garden land
and the garden land seems as common as forest.
m
16
Then judgment will dwell in the wilderness
and justice abide in the garden land.
17
The work of justice will be peace;
the effect of justice, calm and security forever.
n
18
My people will live in peaceful country,
in secure dwellings and quiet resting places.
o
19
And the forest will come down completely,
the city will be utterly laid low.
*
p
20
Happy are you who sow beside every stream,
and let the ox and the donkey go freely!
q
* [
32:14
]
The castle
: the fortified royal palace in Jerusalem.
Citadel
: Ophel, the fortified hill, with its stronghold called “the great projecting tower” (
Neh 3:27
).
