CHAPTER 9
Solomon’s Prayer
*
1
*
God of my ancestors, Lord of mercy,
a
you who have made all things by your word
b
2
And in your wisdom have established humankind
to rule the creatures produced by you,
c
3
And to govern the world in holiness and righteousness,
and to render judgment in integrity of heart:
d
4
Give me Wisdom, the consort at your throne,
and do not reject me from among your children;
e
5
For I am your servant, the child of your maidservant,
a man weak and short-lived
and lacking in comprehension of judgment and of laws.
f
6
Indeed, though one be perfect among mortals,
if Wisdom, who comes from you, be lacking,
that one will count for nothing.
g
7
You have chosen me king over your people
and magistrate over your sons and daughters.
h
8
You have bid me build a temple on your holy mountain
and an altar in the city that is your dwelling place,
a copy of the holy tabernacle which you had established from of old.
i
9
Now with you is Wisdom, who knows your works
and was present when you made the world;
Who understands what is pleasing in your eyes
and what is conformable with your commands.
j
10
Send her forth from your holy heavens
and from your glorious throne dispatch her
That she may be with me and work with me,
that I may know what is pleasing to you.
k
11
For she knows and understands all things,
and will guide me prudently in my affairs
and safeguard me by her glory;
l
12
Thus my deeds will be acceptable,
and I will judge your people justly
and be worthy of my father’s throne.
m
13
For who knows God’s counsel,
or who can conceive what the Lord intends?
n
14
For the deliberations of mortals are timid,
and uncertain our plans.
15
*
For the corruptible body burdens the soul
and the earthly tent weighs down the mind with its many concerns.
o
16
Scarcely can we guess the things on earth,
and only with difficulty grasp what is at hand;
but things in heaven, who can search them out?
p
17
Or who can know your counsel, unless you give Wisdom
and send your holy spirit from on high?
q
18
*
Thus were the paths of those on earth made straight,
and people learned what pleases you,
and were saved by Wisdom.

9:1
–
18
] The author presents his version of Solomon’s prayer (
1 Kgs 3:6
–
9
;
2 Chr 1:8
–
10
).
* [
9:1
–
2
] The author identifies Wisdom with the word of God just as he again identifies Wisdom with the spirit of God in v.
17
. All three are alternate ways of expressing God’s activity in relationship with the world and its inhabitants.
* [
9:15
–
17
] Although the expressions in v.
15
draw on the language of Plato concerning the human condition, the conclusion is very biblical: God remains a mystery (
Jb 38
–
39
;
Eccl 8:17
;
Is 40:12
–
14
;
Rom 11:33
–
34
). The plight of humankind is clearly one of ignorance, unless the “holy spirit” is sent from God.
