PSALM 137
*
Sorrow and Hope in Exile
I
1
By the rivers of Babylon
there we sat weeping
when we remembered Zion.
a
2
On the poplars in its midst
we hung up our harps.
b
3
For there our captors asked us
for the words of a song;
Our tormentors, for joy:
“Sing for us a song of Zion!”
4
But how could we sing a song of the L
ORD
in a foreign land?
II
5
If I forget you, Jerusalem,
may my right hand forget.
c
6
May my tongue stick to my palate
if I do not remember you,
If I do not exalt Jerusalem
beyond all my delights.
III
7
Remember, L
ORD
, against Edom
that day at Jerusalem.
They said: “Level it, level it
down to its foundations!”
d
8
Desolate Daughter Babylon, you shall be destroyed,
blessed the one who pays you back
what you have done us!
e
9
*
Blessed the one who seizes your children
and smashes them against the rock.
f
* [
Psalm 137
] A singer refuses to sing the people’s sacred songs in an alien land despite demands from Babylonian captors (
Ps 137:1
–
4
). The singer swears an oath by what is most dear to a musician—hands and tongue—to exalt Jerusalem always (
Ps 137:5
–
6
). The Psalm ends with a prayer that the old enemies of Jerusalem, Edom and Babylon, be destroyed (
Ps 137:7
–
9
).
* [
137:9
]
Blessed the one who seizes your children and smashes them against the rock
: the children represent the future generations, and so must be destroyed if the enemy is truly to be eradicated.
