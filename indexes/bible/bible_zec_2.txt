CHAPTER 2
Second Vision: The Four Horns and the Four Smiths.
1
I raised my eyes and looked and there were four horns.
*
2
Then I asked the angel who spoke with me, “What are those?” He answered, “Those are the horns that scattered
*
Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
a
3
Then the L
ORD
showed me four workmen.
*
4
And I said, “What are these coming to do?” And the L
ORD
said, “Those are the horns that scattered Judah, so that none could raise their heads any more;
b
and these have come to terrify them—to cut down the horns of the nations that raised their horns to scatter the land of Judah.”
Third Vision: The Man with the Measuring Cord.
5
I raised my eyes and looked, and there was a man with a measuring cord
*
in his hand.
c
6
I asked, “Where are you going?” And he said, “To measure Jerusalem—to see how great its width is and how great its length.”
7
Then the angel who spoke with me advanced as another angel came out to meet him
8
and he said to the latter, “Run, speak to that official:
*
Jerusalem will be unwalled, because of the abundance of people and beasts in its midst.
d
9
I will be an encircling wall of fire
*
for it—oracle of the L
ORD
—and I will be the glory in its midst.”

Expansion on the Themes of the First Three Visions.
10
Up! Up! Flee from the land of the north
*
—oracle of the L
ORD
;—For like the four winds of heaven I have dispersed you—oracle of the L
ORD
.
f
11
Up, Zion! Escape, you who dwell in daughter Babylon!
12
For thus says the L
ORD
of hosts after the L
ORD
’s glory had sent me, concerning the nations that have plundered you: Whoever strikes you strikes me directly in the eye.
g
13
Now I wave my hand over them, and they become plunder for their own servants.
h
Thus you shall know that the L
ORD
of hosts has sent me.
14
Sing and rejoice, daughter Zion! Now, I am coming to dwell in your midst—oracle of the L
ORD
.
15
Many nations will bind themselves to the L
ORD
on that day.
i
They will be my people,
*
and I will dwell in your midst. Then you shall know that the L
ORD
of hosts has sent me to you.
16
The L
ORD
will inherit Judah
j
as his portion of the holy land,
*
and the L
ORD
will again choose Jerusalem.
17
Silence, all people, in the presence of the L
ORD
, who stirs forth from his holy dwelling.
k
* [
2:1
]
Four horns
: symbols of the total political and military might of Judah’s imperial adversaries, probably representing Assyria, Babylonia, and Persia. The number four represents universality rather than any specific number of foes.
* [
2:2
]
Scattered
: sent part of the population into exile. This was standard imperial policy initiated in the ancient Near East by the Assyrians for dealing with a conquered state.
* [
2:3
]
Four workmen
: four agents of God’s power. The imagery follows that of four horns: the workers cut down, or make ineffectual, the horns, i.e., enemy.
* [
2:5
]
Measuring cord
: a string for measuring, as opposed to a builder’s string,
1:16
.
* [
2:8
]
That official
: probably the man with the measuring cord of v.
5
.
* [
2:9
]
Encircling wall of fire
: divine protection for an unwalled Jerusalem. Urban centers were generally walled, and Jerusalem’s walls were eventually rebuilt in the late fifth century B.C. (
Neh 2:17
).
* [
2:10
]
Land of the north
: refers to Babylon (v.
11
), in a geographic rather than a political sense, as the place from which exiles will return. The designation is “north” because imperial invaders historically entered Palestine from that direction (see
Jer 3:18
;
23:8
).
* [
2:15
]
Many nations…my people
: a way of expressing God’s relationship to people in covenant language. The covenant between God and Israel (see
Jer 31:33
;
32:38
) is here universalized to include all nations.
* [
2:16
]
The holy land
: the Lord’s earthly territory, a designation found only rarely in the Old Testament.
