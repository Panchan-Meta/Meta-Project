CHAPTER 61
The Anointed Bearer of Glad Tidings
1
*
The spirit of the Lord G
OD
is upon me,
because the L
ORD
has anointed me;
He has sent me to bring good news to the afflicted,
to bind up the brokenhearted,
To proclaim liberty to the captives,
release to the prisoners,
a
2
To announce a year of favor from the L
ORD
and a day of vindication by our God;
To comfort all who mourn;
b
3
to place on those who mourn in Zion
a diadem instead of ashes,
To give them oil of gladness instead of mourning,
a glorious mantle instead of a faint spirit.
Restoration and Blessing
They will be called oaks of justice,
the planting of the L
ORD
to show his glory.
4
They shall rebuild the ancient ruins,
the former wastes they shall raise up
And restore the desolate cities,
devastations of generation upon generation.
c
5
Strangers shall stand ready to pasture your flocks,
foreigners shall be your farmers and vinedressers.
6
*
You yourselves shall be called “Priests of the L
ORD
,”
“Ministers of our God” you shall be called.
You shall eat the wealth of the nations
and in their riches you will boast.
d
7
Because their shame was twofold
*
and disgrace was proclaimed their portion,
They will possess twofold in their own land;
everlasting joy shall be theirs.
e
God’s Word of Promise
8
For I, the L
ORD
, love justice,
I hate robbery and wrongdoing;
I will faithfully give them their recompense,
an everlasting covenant I will make with them.
f
9
Their offspring shall be renowned among the nations,
and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;
All who see them shall acknowledge them:
“They are offspring the L
ORD
has blessed.”
Thanksgiving for God’s Deliverance
10
*
I will rejoice heartily in the L
ORD
,
my being exults in my God;
For he has clothed me with garments of salvation,
and wrapped me in a robe of justice,
Like a bridegroom adorned with a diadem,
as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
g
11
As the earth brings forth its shoots,
and a garden makes its seeds spring up,
So will the Lord G
OD
make justice spring up,
and praise before all the nations.
* [
61:1
–
2
] The prophet proclaims that he has been anointed by the Lord to bring good news (cf.
40:9
) to the afflicted and to comfort Zion. The background to the “year of favor” is the jubilee year of release from debts (
Lv 25:10
–
11
;
Is 49:8
).
* [
61:6
] The bestowal of a new name suggests a new identity and mission. The whole people will be priests (cf.
Ex 19:6
), even ministering to nations who will serve God’s people.
* [
61:7
]
Twofold
: Israel was punished double for infidelity (
40:2
); the blessings of its restoration will also be double.
* [
61:10
–
11
] The new life of the restored Zion is expressed in nuptial (cf. also
62:5
) and agricultural (cf. v.
3
;
60:21
) imagery.
