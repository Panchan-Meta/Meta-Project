PSALM 45
*
Song for a Royal Wedding
1
For the leader; according to “Lilies.” A
maskil
of the Korahites. A love song.
I
2
My heart is stirred by a noble theme,
as I sing my ode to the king.
My tongue is the pen of a nimble scribe.
II
3
You are the most handsome of men;
fair speech has graced your lips,
for God has blessed you forever.
a
4
Gird your sword upon your hip, mighty warrior!
In splendor and majesty ride on triumphant!
b
5
In the cause of truth, meekness, and justice
may your right hand show your wondrous deeds.
6
Your arrows are sharp;
peoples will cower at your feet;
the king’s enemies will lose heart.
7
Your throne, O God,
*
stands forever;
c
your royal scepter is a scepter for justice.
8
You love justice and hate wrongdoing;
therefore God, your God, has anointed you
with the oil of gladness above your fellow kings.
9
With myrrh, aloes, and cassia
your robes are fragrant.
From ivory-paneled palaces
*
stringed instruments bring you joy.
10
Daughters of kings are your lovely wives;
a princess arrayed in Ophir’s gold
*
comes to stand at your right hand.
III
11
Listen, my daughter, and understand;
pay me careful heed.
Forget your people and your father’s house,
*
12
that the king might desire your beauty.
He is your lord;
13
d
honor him, daughter of Tyre.
Then the richest of the people
will seek your favor with gifts.
14
All glorious is the king’s daughter as she enters,
e
her raiment threaded with gold;
15
In embroidered apparel she is led to the king.
The maids of her train are presented to the king.
16
They are led in with glad and joyous acclaim;
they enter the palace of the king.
IV
17
The throne of your fathers your sons will have;
you shall make them princes through all the land.
f
18
I will make your name renowned through all generations;
thus nations shall praise you forever.

Psalm 45
] A song for the Davidic king’s marriage to a foreign princess from Tyre in Phoenicia. The court poet sings (
Ps 45:2
,
18
) of God’s choice of the king (
Ps 45:3
,
8
), of his role in establishing divine rule (
Ps 45:4
–
8
), and of his splendor as he waits for his bride (
Ps 45:9
–
10
). The woman is to forget her own house when she becomes wife to the king (
Ps 45:11
–
13
). Her majestic beauty today is a sign of the future prosperity of the royal house (
Ps 45:14
–
17
). The Psalm was retained in the collection when there was no reigning king, and came to be applied to the king who was to come, the messiah.
* [
45:7
]
O God
: the king, in courtly language, is called “god,” i.e., more than human, representing God to the people.
Heb 1:8
–
9
applies
Ps 45:7
–
8
to Christ.
* [
45:9
]
Ivory-paneled palaces
: lit., “palaces of ivory.” Ivory paneling and furniture decoration have been found in Samaria and other ancient Near Eastern cities, cf.
Am 3:15
.
* [
45:10
]
Ophir’s gold
: uncertain location, possibly a region on the coast of southern Arabia or eastern Africa, famous for its gold, cf.
1 Kgs 9:28
;
10:11
;
Jb 22:24
.
* [
45:11
]
Forget your people and your father’s house
: the bride should no longer consider herself a daughter of her father’s house, but the wife of the king—the queen.
