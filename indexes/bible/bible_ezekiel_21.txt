CHAPTER 21
The Sword of the Lord.
1
The word of the L
ORD
came to me:
2
*
Son of man, turn your face to the south: preach against the south, prophesy against the forest land in the south.
3
Say to the forest in the south: Hear the word of the L
ORD
! Thus says the Lord G
OD
: See! I am kindling a fire in you that shall devour every green tree as well as every dry tree. The blazing flame shall not be quenched so that from south to north every face shall be scorched by it.
4
All flesh shall see that I, the L
ORD
, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.
a
5
But I said, “Ah! Lord G
OD
, they are saying about me, ‘Is not this the one who is forever spinning parables?’”
6
Then the word of the L
ORD
came to me:
7
Son of man, turn your face toward Jerusalem: preach against its sanctuary, prophesy against the land of Israel.
b
8
Say to the land of Israel: Thus says the L
ORD
: See! I am coming against you; I will draw my sword from its scabbard and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.
*
9
Thus my sword shall come out from its scabbard against all flesh from south to north
10
and all flesh shall know that I, the L
ORD
, have drawn my sword from its scabbard. It cannot return again.
c
Act Symbolic of the City’s Fall.
11
As for you, son of man, groan! with shattered loins and bitter grief, groan in their sight.
12
When they ask you, “Why are you groaning?” you shall say: Because of what I heard!
*
When it comes every heart shall melt, every hand fall helpless; every spirit will grow faint, and every knee run with water. See, it is coming, it is here!—oracle of the Lord G
OD
.
Song of the Sword.
13
The word of the L
ORD
came to me:
d
14
Son of man, prophesy! say: Thus says the L
ORD
:
A sword, a sword has been sharpened,
a sword, a sword has been burnished:
e
15
Sharpened to make a slaughter,
burnished to flash lightning!
Why should I stop now?
You have rejected the rod and every judgment!
16
I have given it over to the burnisher
that he might hold it in his hand,
A sword sharpened and burnished
to be put in the hands of an executioner.
17
Cry out and howl, son of man,
for it is destined for my people,
For all the princes of Israel,
victims of the sword with my people.
Therefore, slap your thigh,
*
18
for it is tested, and why not?
Since you rejected my staff,
should it not happen?—
oracle of the Lord G
OD
.
19
As for you, son of man, prophesy,
and clap your hands!
Let the sword strike twice, a third time.
It is a sword of slaughter,
A sword for slaughtering,
whirling around them all,
20
That every heart may tremble;
for many will be made to stumble.
At all their gates
I have stationed the sword for slaughter,
Made it flash lightning,
drawn for slaughter.
21
Slash to the right!
turn to the left,
Wherever your edge is directed!
f
22
Then I, too, shall clap my hands,
*
and spend my fury.
I, the L
ORD
, have spoken.
Nebuchadnezzar at the Crossroads.
23
The word of the L
ORD
came to me:
24
Son of man, make for yourself two roads over which the sword of the king of Babylon can come. Both roads shall start out from the same land. Then put a signpost at the head of each road
25
so the sword can come to Rabbah of the Ammonites or to Judah and its fortress, Jerusalem.
26
For the king of Babylon is standing at the fork of the two roads to read the omens:
*
he shakes out the arrows, inquires of the teraphim, inspects the liver.
g
27
Into his right hand has fallen the lot marked “Jerusalem”:
*
to order the slaughter, to raise the battle cry, to set the battering rams against the gates, to throw up a ramp, to build siege works.
28
In the eyes of those bound by oath this seems like a false omen; yet the lot taken in hand exposes the wickedness for which they, still bound by oath, will be taken in hand.
29
Therefore thus says the Lord G
OD
: Because your guilt has been exposed, your crimes laid bare, your sinfulness revealed in all your deeds—because you have been exposed, you shall be taken in hand.
h
30
And as for you, depraved and wicked prince of Israel, a day is coming to end your life of crime.
i
31
Thus says the Lord G
OD
: Off with the turban and away with the crown! Nothing shall be as it was! Exalt the lowly and bring the exalted low!
32
A ruin, a ruin, a ruin, I shall make it! Nothing will be the same until the one comes to whom I have given it for judgment.
j
To the Ammonites.
*
33
As for you, son of man, prophesy: Thus says the Lord G
OD
to the Ammonites and their insults:
O sword, sword drawn for slaughter,
burnished to consume, to flash lightning!
34
Your false visions and lying omens,
Set you over the necks of the slain,
the wicked whose day had come—
an end to their life of crime.
35
Return to your scabbard!
In the place you were created,
In the land of your origin,
I will judge you.
36
I will pour out my anger upon you,
breathing my fiery wrath against you;
I will hand you over to ravagers,
artisans of destruction!
37
You shall be fuel for the fire,
your blood shall flow throughout the land;
You shall not be remembered,
for I, the L
ORD
, have spoken.
* [
21:2
–
4
] In Babylon Ezekiel looks toward Judah, pictured as a forest about to be destroyed by fire.
* [
21:8
]
Cut off from you the righteous and the wicked
: a more complete devastation of Jerusalem than that described in
9:6
.
* [
21:12
]
What I heard
: the news of the fall of Jerusalem; cf.
33:21
–
22
.
* [
21:17
]
Slap your thigh
: a gesture signifying grief and dread; cf.
Jer 31:19
.
* [
21:22
]
Clap my hands
: the Lord declares himself no longer responsible for Judah; cf.
22:13
;
Nm 24:10
;
Jb 27:23
;
Lam 2:15
.
* [
21:26
] Three forms of divination are mentioned: arrow divination, consisting in the use of differently marked arrows extracted or shaken from a case at random; the consultation of the teraphim or household idols; and liver divination, scrutiny of the configurations of the livers of newly slaughtered animals, a common form of divination in Mesopotamia.
* [
21:27
–
28
] A lot marked “Jerusalem” falls out, which marks the guilt of the city’s inhabitants.
* [
21:33
–
37
] In vv.
23
–
32
Ezekiel imagines Nebuchadnezzar deciding whether to attack Jerusalem or Rabbath-Ammon. As it happened, the Babylonians decided to attack Jerusalem first. Here (vv.
33
–
37
) Ezekiel prophesies to the Ammonites that a nation which serves as an instrument of the Lord’s judgment will itself be judged.
