CHAPTER 7
A Question About Fasting.
1
In the fourth year of Darius the king, the word of the L
ORD
came to Zechariah, on the fourth day of the ninth month, Kislev.
*
2
Bethelsarezer sent Regem-melech and his men to implore the favor of the L
ORD
3
and to ask the priests of the house of the L
ORD
of hosts, and the prophets, “Must I weep and abstain in the fifth month
*
as I have been doing these many years?”
4
Then the word of the L
ORD
of hosts came to me:
5
Say to all the people of the land and to the priests: When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and in the seventh month
*
these seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted?
a
6
When you were eating and drinking, was it not for yourselves that you ate and for yourselves that you drank?
7
Are these not the words which the L
ORD
proclaimed through the earlier prophets,
*
when Jerusalem and its surrounding cities were inhabited and secure, when the Negeb and the Shephelah were inhabited?
8
The word of the L
ORD
came to Zechariah:
9
Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts: Judge with true justice, and show kindness and compassion toward each other.
b
10
Do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the resident alien or the poor;
*
do not plot evil against one another in your hearts.
c
11
But they refused to listen; they stubbornly turned their backs and stopped their ears so as not to hear.
d
12
And they made their hearts as hard as diamond
e
so as not to hear the instruction and the words that the L
ORD
of hosts had sent by his spirit through the earlier prophets. So great anger came from the L
ORD
of hosts:
13
Just as when I called out and they did not listen, so they will call out and I will not listen, says the L
ORD
of hosts.
14
And I will scatter them among all the nations that they do not know.
f
So the land was left desolate behind them with no one moving about, and they made a pleasant land into a wasteland.
