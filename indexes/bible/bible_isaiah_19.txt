CHAPTER 19
Egypt
1
Oracle on Egypt:
See, the L
ORD
is riding on a swift cloud
on his way to Egypt;
The idols of Egypt tremble before him,
the hearts of the Egyptians melt within them.
a
2
I will stir up Egypt against Egypt:
brother will war against brother,
Neighbor against neighbor,
city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
3
The courage of the Egyptians shall ebb away within them,
and I will bring their counsel to nought;
They shall consult idols and charmers, ghosts and clairvoyants.
b
4
I will deliver Egypt
into the power of a cruel master,
A harsh king
*
who shall rule over them—
oracle of the Lord, the L
ORD
of hosts.
c
5
The waters shall be drained from the sea,
the river shall parch and dry up;
d
6
Its streams shall become foul,
and the canals of Egypt shall dwindle and parch.
e
Reeds and rushes shall wither away,
7
and bulrushes on the bank of the Nile;
f
All the sown land along the Nile
shall dry up and blow away, and be no more.
8
The fishermen shall mourn and lament,
all who cast hook in the Nile;
Those who spread their nets in the water
shall pine away.
9
The linen-workers shall be disappointed,
the combers and weavers shall turn pale;
g
10
The spinners shall be crushed,
all the hired laborers shall be despondent.
11
Utter fools are the princes of Zoan!
*
the wisest of Pharaoh’s advisers give stupid counsel.
How can you say to Pharaoh,
“I am a descendant of wise men, of ancient kings”?
12
Where then are your wise men?
Let them tell you and make known
What the L
ORD
of hosts has planned
against Egypt.
h
13
The princes of Zoan have become fools,
the princes of Memphis have been deceived.
The chiefs of its tribes
have led Egypt astray.
i
14
The L
ORD
has prepared among them
a spirit of dizziness,
And they have made Egypt stagger in whatever she does,
as a drunkard staggers in his vomit.
j
15
Egypt shall accomplish nothing—
neither head nor tail, palm branch nor reed,
*
shall accomplish anything.
16
On that day the Egyptians shall be like women, trembling with fear, because of the L
ORD
of hosts shaking his fist at them.
k
17
And the land of Judah shall be a terror to the Egyptians. Every time they think of Judah, they shall stand in dread because of the plan the L
ORD
of hosts has in mind for them.
18
On that day there shall be five cities
*
in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan and swear by the L
ORD
of hosts; one shall be called “City of the Sun.”
19
On that day there shall be an altar to the L
ORD
at the center of Egypt, and a sacred pillar to the L
ORD
near its boundary.
20
This will be a sign and witness to the L
ORD
of hosts in the land of Egypt, so that when they cry out to the L
ORD
because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior to defend and deliver them.
l
21
The L
ORD
shall make himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the L
ORD
in that day; they shall offer sacrifices and oblations, make vows to the L
ORD
and fulfill them.
m
22
Although the L
ORD
shall smite Egypt severely, he shall heal them; they shall turn to the L
ORD
and he shall be moved by their entreaty and heal them.
n
23
On that day there shall be a highway from Egypt to Assyria; the Assyrians shall enter Egypt, and the Egyptians enter Assyria, and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.
24
On that day Israel shall be a third party with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth,
o
25
when the L
ORD
of hosts gives this blessing: “Blessed be my people Egypt, and the work of my hands Assyria, and my heritage, Israel.”
