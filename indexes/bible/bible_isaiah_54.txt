CHAPTER 54
The New Zion
1
Raise a glad cry, you barren one
*
who never bore a child,
break forth in jubilant song, you who have never been in labor,
For more numerous are the children of the deserted wife
than the children of her who has a husband,
says the L
ORD
.
a
2
Enlarge the space for your tent,
spread out your tent cloths unsparingly;
lengthen your ropes and make firm your pegs.
b
3
For you shall spread abroad to the right and left;
your descendants shall dispossess the nations
and shall people the deserted cities.
*
4
*
Do not fear, you shall not be put to shame;
do not be discouraged, you shall not be disgraced.
For the shame of your youth you shall forget,
the reproach of your widowhood no longer remember.
5
For your husband is your Maker;
the L
ORD
of hosts is his name,
Your redeemer,
*
the Holy One of Israel,
called God of all the earth.
6
The L
ORD
calls you back,
like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit,
A wife married in youth and then cast off,
says your God.
c
7
For a brief moment I abandoned you,
but with great tenderness I will take you back.
8
In an outburst of wrath, for a moment
I hid my face from you;
But with enduring love I take pity on you,
says the L
ORD
, your redeemer.
9
This is for me like the days of Noah:
As I swore then that the waters of Noah
should never again flood the earth,
So I have sworn now not to be angry with you,
or to rebuke you.
d
10
Though the mountains fall away
and the hills be shaken,
My love shall never fall away from you
nor my covenant of peace
*
be shaken,
says the L
ORD
, who has mercy on you.
e
11
O afflicted one,
*
storm-battered and unconsoled,
I lay your pavements in carnelians,
your foundations in sapphires;
f
12
I will make your battlements of rubies,
your gates of jewels,
and all your walls of precious stones.
13
All your children shall be taught by the L
ORD
;
great shall be the peace of your children.
14
In justice shall you be established,
far from oppression, you shall not fear,
from destruction, it cannot come near.
15
If there be an attack, it is not my doing;
whoever attacks shall fall before you.
16
See, I have created the smith
who blows on the burning coals
and forges weapons as his work;
It is I also who have created
the destroyer to work havoc.
17
Every weapon fashioned against you shall fail;
every tongue that brings you to trial
you shall prove false.
This is the lot of the servants of the L
ORD
,
their vindication from me—oracle of the L
ORD
.
* [
54:1
] Jerusalem, pictured as a wife who had been barren and deserted, now suddenly finds herself with innumerable children (the returning exiles); cf.
Gal 4:27
for an application to a new context.
* [
54:3
] Those who had taken advantage of the exile to encroach on Jerusalem’s territory will be driven out, and the returning exiles will repopulate the cities of Judah.
* [
54:4
–
8
] As with some other Old Testament themes, Second Isaiah uses that of Israel as the Lord’s bride in a new manner. Whereas Hosea and Jeremiah had depicted Israel as the Lord’s spouse to emphasize both Israel’s infidelity and the Lord’s continued love (
Hos 1
–
3
;
Jer 2:2
;
3:1
–
15
) and Ezekiel to accuse Israel unsparingly (
Ez 16
;
23
), Second Isaiah speaks only of the love with which the Lord restores the people, speaking tender words with no hint of reproach.
* [

Redeemer
: cf. note on
41:14
.
* [
54:10
]
Covenant of peace
: this whole section, vv.
9
–
17
, is given to various assurances of God’s love for Israel and of safety from various possible threats; the phrase sums up both the positive aspects of
shalom
, which implies a fullness of blessing, and protection from all that might harm. Cf. also
55:3
;
Nm 25:12
;
Ez 34:25
;
37:26
;
Mal 2:5
