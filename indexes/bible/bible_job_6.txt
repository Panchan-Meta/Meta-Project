CHAPTER 6
Job’s First Reply.
1
Then Job answered and said:
2
Ah, could my anguish but be measured
and my calamity laid with it in the scales,
3
They would now outweigh the sands of the sea!
Because of this I speak without restraint.
4
For the arrows of the Almighty are in me,
a
and my spirit drinks in their poison;
the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
5
Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass?
*
Does the ox low over its fodder?
6
Can anything insipid be eaten without salt?
Is there flavor in the white of an egg?
7
I refuse to touch them;
they are like loathsome food to me.
8
Oh, that I might have my request,
and that God would grant what I long for:
9
Even that God would decide to crush me,
that he would put forth his hand and cut me off!
10
Then I should still have consolation
and could exult through unremitting pain,
because I have not transgressed the commands of the Holy One.
11
What strength have I that I should endure,
and what is my limit that I should be patient?
12
Have I the strength of stones,
or is my flesh of bronze?
13
Have I no helper,
b
and has my good sense deserted me?
14
A friend owes kindness to one in despair,
though he has forsaken the fear of the Almighty.
15
My companions are undependable as a wadi,
as watercourses that run dry in the wadies;
16
Though they may be black with ice,
and with snow heaped upon them,
17
Yet once they flow, they cease to be;
in the heat, they disappear from their place.
18
Caravans wander from their routes;
they go into the wasteland and perish.
19
The caravans of Tema
*
search,
the companies of Sheba have hopes;
20
They are disappointed, though they were confident;
they come there and are frustrated.
21
It is thus that you have now become for me;
*
you see a terrifying thing and are afraid.
22
Have I said, “Give me something,
make a bribe on my behalf from your possessions”?
23
Or “Deliver me from the hand of the enemy,
redeem me from oppressors”?
24
Teach me, and I will be silent;
make me understand how I have erred.
25
How painful honest words can be;
yet how unconvincing is your argument!
26
Do you consider your words as proof,
but the sayings of a desperate man as wind?
27
You would even cast lots for the orphan,
and would barter over your friend!
28
Come, now, give me your attention;
surely I will not lie to your face.
29
Think it over; let there be no injustice.
Think it over; I still am right.
30
Is there insincerity on my tongue,
or cannot my taste discern falsehood?
* [
6:5
–
6
] Job would not complain if his life were as pleasant to him as fodder to a hungry animal; but his life is as disagreeable as insipid food.
White of an egg
: thus the obscure Hebrew has been understood in Jewish tradition; some render it “mallow juice.”
* [
6:19
]
Tema
: in northwest Arabia.
Sheba
: home of the Sabeans; see note on
1:15
.
* [
6:21
] It is only at this point that the previous lines (vv.
1
–
20
) are clearly directed to the three friends. The style of replying in these chapters (
3
–
31
) is often indirect. Job and the friends become mouthpieces through which the author presents current views on divine retribution in dramatic fashion. In chap.
7
, Job will not even speak directly to the friends.
