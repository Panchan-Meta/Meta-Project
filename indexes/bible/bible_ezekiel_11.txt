CHAPTER 11
Death for the Remnant in Jerusalem.
1
The spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the house of the L
ORD
facing east. There at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men; among them I saw the public officials Jaazaniah, son of Azzur, and Pelatiah, son of Benaiah.
2
The L
ORD
said to me: Son of man, these are the men who are planning evil and giving wicked counsel in this city.
3
They are saying, “No need to build houses! The city is the pot, and we are the meat.”
*
a
4
Therefore prophesy against them, son of man, prophesy!
5
Then the spirit of the L
ORD
fell upon me and told me to say: Thus says the L
ORD
: This is how you talk, house of Israel. I know the things that come into your mind!
6
You have slain many in this city, filled its streets with the slain.
7
Therefore thus says the Lord G
OD
: The slain whom you piled up in it, that is the meat, the pot is the city. But you I will bring out of it.
b
8
You fear the sword—that sword I will bring upon you—oracle of the Lord G
OD
.
c
9
I will bring you out of the city, hand you over to foreigners, and execute judgments against you.
10
By the sword you shall fall. At the borders of Israel I will judge you so that you will know that I am the L
ORD
.
11
The city shall not be a pot for you, nor shall you be meat within it. At the borders of Israel I will judge you,
d
12
so you shall know that I am the L
ORD
, whose statutes you did not follow, whose ordinances you did not keep. Instead, you acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you.
13
While I was prophesying, Pelatiah, the son of Benaiah, dropped dead. I fell down on my face and cried out in a loud voice: “Alas, Lord G
OD
! You are finishing off what remains of Israel!”
*
e
Restoration for the Exiles.
14
The word of the L
ORD
came to me:
15
*
Son of man, the inhabitants of Jerusalem are saying about all your relatives, the other exiles, and all the house of Israel, “They are far away from the L
ORD
. The land is given to us as a possession.”
f
16
Therefore say: Thus says the Lord G
OD
: I have indeed sent them far away among the nations, scattered them over the lands, and have been but little sanctuary for them in the lands to which they have gone.
17
Therefore, thus says the Lord G
OD
, I will gather you from the nations and collect you from the lands through which you were scattered, so I can give you the land of Israel.
g
18
They will enter it and remove all its atrocities and abominations.
19
h
And I will give them another heart and a new spirit I will put within them. From their bodies I will remove the hearts of stone, and give them hearts of flesh,
20
so that they walk according to my statutes, taking care to keep my ordinances. Thus they will be my people, and I will be their God.
i
21
But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their atrocities and abominations, I will bring their conduct down upon their heads—oracle of the Lord G
OD
.
22
Then the cherubim lifted their wings and the wheels alongside them, with the glory of the God of Israel above them.
j
23
*
The glory of the L
ORD
rose up from the middle of the city and came to rest on the mountain east of the city.
k
24
In a vision, the spirit lifted me up and brought me back to the exiles in Chaldea, by the spirit of God. The vision I had seen left me,
l
25
and I told the exiles everything the L
ORD
had shown me.
m
* [
11:3
]
No need to build houses…meat
: this advice is based on the conviction that invincible Jerusalem will protect its citizens from further danger just as a pot shields the meat inside from the fire. The poorer citizens of Jerusalem and the refugees from nearby villages can now appropriate the property abandoned by the city’s wealthier upper class when they were deported (v.
15
). The metaphor of the pot and its contents reappears in chap.
24
.
* [
11:13
] In Ezekiel’s vision Pelatiah represents the people left in Jerusalem, “the remnant of Israel.” His sudden death in the vision, but not in reality, is a figure for the judgment described in vv.
8
–
10
and prompts Ezekiel’s anguished question about the survival of the people left in the land after the deportations in 597.
* [
11:15
–
21
] Ezekiel insists that those who remained in Judah are doomed; the exiles, under a new covenant, will constitute a new Israel. Cf. chap.
36
;
Jer 24:7
;
29
.
* [
11:23
] The glory of the Lord departs toward the east, to the exiles in Babylon; it will return once the Temple is rebuilt (
43:1
–
3
).
