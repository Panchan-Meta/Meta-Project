CHAPTER 13
1
All this my eye has seen;
my ear has heard and perceived it.
2
What you know, I also know;
a
I do not fall short of you.
3
But I would speak with the Almighty;
b
I want to argue with God.
4
But you gloss over falsehoods,
you are worthless physicians, every one of you!
5
Oh, that you would be altogether silent;
that for you would be wisdom!
6
Hear now my argument
and listen to the accusations from my lips.
7
Is it for God that you speak falsehood?
Is it for him that you utter deceit?
8
Is it for him that you show partiality?
Do you make accusations on behalf of God?
9
Will it be well when he shall search you out?
Can you deceive him as you do a mere human being?
10
He will openly rebuke you
if in secret you show partiality.
11
Surely his majesty will frighten you
and dread of him fall upon you.
12
Your reminders are ashy maxims,
your fabrications mounds of clay.
13
Be silent! Let me alone that I may speak,
no matter what happens to me.
14
I will carry my flesh between my teeth,
and take my life in my hand.
*
15
Slay me though he might,
c
I will wait for him;
*
I will defend my conduct before him.
16
This shall be my salvation:
no impious man can come into his presence.
17
Pay close attention to my speech,
give my statement a hearing.
18
Behold, I have prepared my case,
d
I know that I am in the right.
19
If anyone can make a case against me,
then I shall be silent and expire.
20
Two things only do not use against me,
*
then from your presence I need not hide:
21
Withdraw your hand far from me,
do not let the terror of you frighten me.
22
Then call me, and I will respond;
or let me speak first, and answer me.
23
What are my faults and my sins?
My misdeed, my sin make known to me!
24
Why do you hide your face
and consider me your enemy?
*
e
25
Will you harass a wind-driven leaf
or pursue a withered straw?
26
For you draw up bitter indictments against me,
and punish in me the faults of my youth.
27
You put my feet in the stocks;
you watch all my paths
and trace out all my footsteps,
28
Though I wear out like a leather bottle,
like a garment the moth has consumed.
* [
13:14
] The second half of the verse is a common biblical expression for risking one’s life; cf.
Jgs 12:3
;
1 Sm 19:5
;
28:21
;
Ps 119:109
; the first half of the verse must have a similar meaning. Job is so confident of his innocence that he is willing to risk his life by going to judgment with God.
* [
13:15
] Many translations adopt the Ketib reading, “I have no hope.”
* [
13:20
] In
13:20
–
14:22
, Job directs his address to God; cf.
7:8
–
21
;
9:28
–
10:22
. His three friends never do this.
* [
13:24
] The Hebrew word for “enemy” (
‘oyeb
) is very close to the Hebrew form of Job’s name (
‘iyyob
). The play on the word implies that God has confused the two.
