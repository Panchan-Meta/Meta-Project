CHAPTER 34
1
Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo,
a
the peak of Pisgah which faces Jericho, and the L
ORD
showed him all the land—Gilead, and as far as Dan,
2
all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,
b
3
the Negeb, the plain (the valley of Jericho, the City of Palms), and as far as Zoar.
4
The L
ORD
then said to him, This is the land
c
about which I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, “I will give it to your descendants.” I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you shall not cross over.
5
So there, in the land of Moab, Moses, the servant of the L
ORD
, died
d
as the L
ORD
had said;
6
and he was buried in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; to this day no one knows the place of his burial.
e
7
Moses was one hundred and twenty years old
f
when he died, yet his eyes were undimmed and his vigor unabated.
8
The Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days, till they had completed the period of grief and mourning for Moses.
9
Now Joshua, son of Nun,
g
was filled with the spirit of wisdom, since Moses had laid his hands upon him; and so the Israelites gave him their obedience, just as the L
ORD
had commanded Moses.
10
h
Since then no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the L
ORD
knew face to face,
11
i
in all the signs and wonders the L
ORD
sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh and all his servants and against all his land,
12
and all the great might and the awesome power that Moses displayed in the sight of all Israel.
