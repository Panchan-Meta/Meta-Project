CHAPTER 16
The Joseph Tribes.
*
1
The lot that fell to the Josephites extended from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho east of the wilderness; then the boundary went up from Jericho to the heights at Bethel.
*
2
Leaving Bethel for Luz, it crossed the ridge to the border of the Archites at Ataroth,
3
and descended westward to the border of the Japhletites, to that of the Lower Beth-horon, and to Gezer, and from there to the sea.

the dividing line

and thence to the sea. From Michmethath
c
on the north, their boundary curved eastward around Taanath-shiloh, and continued east of it to Janoah;
7
from there it descended to Ataroth and Naarah, and reaching Jericho, it ended at the Jordan.
8
From Tappuah the boundary ran westward to the Wadi Kanah and ended at the sea. This was the heritage of the Ephraimites by their clans,
9
including the villages that belonged to each city set aside for the Ephraimites within the heritage of the Manassites.

But they did not dispossess the Canaanites living in Gezer;
d
they live within Ephraim to the present day, though they have been put to forced labor.
