CHAPTER 25
Bildad’s Third Speech.
1
*
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2
Dominion and dread are his
who brings about harmony in his heavens.
3
Is there any numbering of his troops?
*
Yet on which of them does his light not rise?
4
How can anyone be in the right against God,
a
or how can any born of woman be innocent?
5
Even the moon is not bright
and the stars are not clean in his eyes.
6
How much less a human being, who is but a worm,
a mortal, who is only a maggot?

* [
25:1
] At this point any structure in the dialogues disappears. Bildad’s speech is very short, and there follow two speeches attributed to Job, with significantly different introductions in
27:1
and
29:1
, and with no intervening third speech of Zophar.
* [
25:3
]
His troops
: the heavenly host, or army, the stars (cf.
Jgs 5:20
), later understood as angels.
