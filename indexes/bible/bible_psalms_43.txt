PSALM 43
1
Grant me justice, O God;
defend me from a faithless people;
from the deceitful and unjust rescue me.
a
2
You, O God, are my strength.
Why then do you spurn me?
Why must I go about mourning,
with the enemy oppressing me?
3
b
Send your light and your fidelity,
*
that they may be my guide;
c
Let them bring me to your holy mountain,
to the place of your dwelling,
4
That I may come to the altar of God,
to God, my joy, my delight.
Then I will praise you with the harp,
O God, my God.
5
Why are you downcast, my soul?
Why do you groan within me?
Wait for God, for I shall again praise him,
my savior and my God.
* [
43:3
]
Your light and your fidelity
: a pair of divine attributes personified as guides for the pilgrimage. As in
Ps 42:9
the psalmist prays that these divine attributes lead him back to Jerusalem and ultimately to God’s presence in the Temple.
