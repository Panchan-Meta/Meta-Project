CHAPTER 15
Parable of the Vine.
1
*
The word of the L
ORD
came to me:
2
Son of man,
what makes the wood of the vine
Better than the wood of branches
found on the trees in the forest?
a
3
Can wood be taken from it
to make something useful?
Can someone make even a peg out of it
on which to hang a vessel?
4
Of course not! If it is fed to the fire for fuel,
and the fire devours both ends of it,
Leaving the middle charred,
is it useful for anything then?
5
Even when it is whole
it cannot be used for anything;
So when fire has devoured and charred it,
how useful can it be?
6
Therefore, thus says the Lord G
OD
:
Like vine wood among forest trees,
which I have given as fuel for fire,
So I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
7
I will set my face against them:
Although they have escaped the fire,
the fire will still devour them;
You shall know that I am the L
ORD
,
when I set my face against them.
b
8
Yes, I will make the land desolate,
because they are so unfaithful—
oracle of the Lord G
OD
.
