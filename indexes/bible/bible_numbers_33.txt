CHAPTER 33
Stages of the Journey.
1
The following are the stages by which the Israelites went out by companies from the land of Egypt under the guidance of Moses and Aaron.
*
2
Moses recorded the starting points of the various stages at the direction of the L
ORD
. These are the stages according to their starting points:
3
They set out from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month. On the day after the Passover the Israelites went forth in triumph, in view of all Egypt,
4
while the Egyptians buried those whom the L
ORD
had struck down, every firstborn; on their gods, too, the L
ORD
executed judgments.

Setting out from Kadesh, they camped at Mount Hor on the border of the land of Edom.

Conquest and Division of Canaan.
50
The L
ORD
spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho:
51
Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you go across the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
52
dispossess all the inhabitants of the land before you; destroy all their stone figures, destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places.
j
53
You will take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess.
54
You will apportion the land among yourselves by lot, clan by clan, assigning a large heritage to a large clan and a small heritage to a small clan.
k
Wherever anyone’s lot falls, there will his possession be; you will apportion these shares within your ancestral tribe.
55
But if you do not dispossess the inhabitants of the land before you, those whom you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in the land where you live,
l
56
and I will treat you as I had intended to treat them.
* [
33:1
–
3
] According to v.
2
, this list of camping sites was drawn up by Moses as an itinerary recording Israel’s trek through the wilderness. Comparison with the more detailed accounts of the journey as given elsewhere suggests that the list is not necessarily comprehensive. It records just forty camping sites, not counting the starting place, Rameses, and the terminus, the plains of Moab. This number, which corresponds exactly to the forty years of wandering in the wilderness, is probably a schematic device. Moreover, it seems that in its present form the order of some of the names here has been disturbed. Several names listed here are not recorded elsewhere.
* [
33:30
–
36
] Moseroth is mentioned in
Dt 10:6
(in the form of “Moserah”) as the place where Aaron died, apparently a variant of the tradition here in v.
38
regarding the place of Aaron’s death; so also
Nm 20:22
–
24
and
Dt 32:50
. Perhaps Moseroth was close to Mount Hor.
* [
33:35
]
Ezion-geber
: Solomon conducted sea trade with Ophir from this port (
1 Kgs 9:26
), today probably identified on the northern coast of the Gulf of Elath between the Jordanian city of Aqabah and the Israeli city of Elath.
* [
33:40
] The verse repeats almost verbatim the same introduction to the account of the victory over Arad as is given in
21:1
–
3
, where it also follows the account of Aaron’s death. Perhaps the isolated verse here is intended by the editor(s) of Numbers to point the reader to the fuller account given there.
