CHAPTER 1
Greeting.
*
1
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the holy ones who are [in Ephesus]
*
faithful in Christ Jesus:
a
2
grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
b
The Father’s Plan of Salvation.
3
*
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
c
who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavens,
*
4
as he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and without blemish before him.
d
In love
5
he destined us for adoption to himself through Jesus Christ, in accord with the favor of his will,
e
6
for the praise of the glory of his grace that he granted us in the beloved.
f
Fulfillment through Christ.
7
In him we have redemption by his blood, the forgiveness of transgressions, in accord with the riches of his grace
g
8
that he lavished upon us. In all wisdom and insight,
h
9
he has made known to us the mystery
*
of his will in accord with his favor that he set forth in him
i
10
as a plan for the fullness of times, to sum up all things in Christ, in heaven and on earth.
j
Inheritance through the Spirit.
11
In him we were also chosen, destined in accord with the purpose of the One who accomplishes all things according to the intention of his will,
k
12
so that we might exist for the praise of his glory, we who first hoped
*
in Christ.
13
In him you also, who have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and have believed in him, were sealed
*
with the promised holy Spirit,
l
14
which is the first installment
*
of our inheritance toward redemption as God’s possession, to the praise of his glory.
m
II. Unity of the Church in Christ
The Church as Christ’s Body.
*
15
Therefore, I, too, hearing of your faith in the Lord Jesus and of your love
*
for all the holy ones,
n
16
do not cease giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,
o
17
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation resulting in knowledge of him.
p
18
May the eyes of [your] hearts be enlightened, that you may know what is the hope that belongs to his call, what are the riches of glory in his inheritance among the holy ones,
q
19
and what is the surpassing greatness of his power for us who believe, in accord with the exercise of his great might,
r
20
which he worked in Christ, raising him from the dead and seating him at his right hand in the heavens,
s
21
far above every principality, authority, power, and dominion, and every name that is named not only in this age but also in the one to come.
t
22
And he put all things beneath his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church,
u
23
which is his body,
*
the fullness of the one who fills all things in every way.

* [
1:1
–
2
] For the epistolary form used at the beginning of letters, see note on
Rom 1:1
–
7
. Twenty-two of the thirty Greek words in
Eph 1:1
–
2
also occur in
Col 1:1
–
2
.
* [
1:1
]
[In Ephesus]
: the phrase is lacking in important early witnesses such as P
46
(3rd cent.), and Sinaiticus and Vaticanus (4th cent.), appearing in the latter two as a fifth-century addition. Basil and Origen mention its absence from manuscripts. See Introduction. Without the phrase, the Greek can be rendered, as in
Col 1:2
, “to the holy ones and faithful brothers in Christ.”
* [
1:3
–
14
] While a Pauline letter usually continues after the greeting with a prayer of thanksgiving, as in
Eph 1:15
–
23
below, Ephesians first inserts a blessing of God for the blessings Christians have experienced, as in
2 Cor 1:3
–
4
and
1 Pt 1:3
–
12
. The blessing here, akin to a Jewish
berakah
, is rich in images almost certainly drawn from hymns and liturgy. Many ideas here are also found in
Col 1:3
–
23
. Certain phrases are frequently repeated, such as
in Christ
(
Eph 1:3
,
10
,
12
) or
in him
(
Eph 1:4
,
7
,
9
,
11
,
13
) or
in the beloved
(
Eph 1:6
) and
(for) the praise of (his) glory
(
Eph 1:6
,
12
,
14
). Some terms like
chose
(
Eph 1:4
) and
destined
(
Eph 1:5
) reflect Old Testament theology (
Dt 7:7
;
9:4
–
6
;
23:5
) or Pauline themes (
redemption
,
Eph 1:7
,
14
;
grace
,
Eph 1:6
,
7
) or specific emphases in Colossians (
forgiveness
,
Col 1:14
). A triadic structure is discernible in
Eph 1:3
–
14
:
God
the
Father
(
Eph 1:3
–
6
,
8
,
11
),
Christ
(
Eph 1:3
,
5
,
7
–
10
,
12
), and the
Spirit
(
Eph 1:13
–
14
). The spiritual blessings Christians have received through Christ (
Eph 1:3
) are gratefully enumerated: the call to holiness (
Eph 1:4
; cf.
Col 1:22
); the gift of divine
adoption
establishing a unique spiritual relationship with God the Father through Christ (
Eph 1:5
; cf.
Gal 4:5
); liberation from sin through Christ’s sacrificial death (
Eph 1:7
); revelation of God’s plan of salvation in Christ (
Eph 1:9
; cf.
Eph 3:3
–
4
;
Rom 16:25
); the gift of election and faith in Christ bestowed upon Jewish Christians (see note on
Eph 1:12
,
we who first hoped in Christ
); and finally, the same gift granted to Gentiles (
Eph 1:13
,
you also
). In the Christ-centered faith and existence of the Christian communities the apostle sees the predetermined
plan
of God to bring all creation under the final rule of Christ (
Eph 1:4
–
5
,
9
–
10
) being
made known
(
Eph 1:9
) and carried through, to God’s glory (
Eph 1:6
,
12
,
14
).
* [
1:3
]
In the heavens
: literally, “in the heavenlies” or “in the heavenly places,” a term in Ephesians for the divine realm.
* [
1:9
]
Mystery
: as in
Rom 16:25
;
Col 1:26
,
27
and elsewhere, a secret of God now revealed in the
plan
to save and
sum up all things in Christ
(
Eph 1:10
); cf.
Eph 3:3
–
6
.
* [
1:12
]
We who first hoped
: probably Jewish Christians (contrast
Eph 1:13
,
you
, the Gentiles); possibly the people of Israel, “we who already enjoyed the hope of Christ,” or perhaps present hope in contrast to future redemption (cf.
Eph 1:14
).
* [
1:13
]
Sealed
: by God, in baptism; cf.
Eph 4:30
;
2 Cor 1:22
.
* [
1:14
]
First installment
: down payment by God on full salvation, as at
2 Cor 1:22
.
* [
1:15
–
23
] See note on
Rom 1:8
for the thanksgiving form in a letter. Much of the content parallels thoughts in
Col 1:3
–
20
. The prayer moves from God and Christ (
Eph 1:17
,
20
–
21
) to the Ephesians (
Eph 1:17
–
19
) and the church (
Eph 1:22
–
23
). Paul asks that the blessing imparted by God the Father (
Eph 1:3
) to the Ephesians will be strengthened in them through the message of the gospel (
Eph 1:13
,
17
–
19
). Those blessings are seen in the context of God’s
might
in establishing the sovereignty of Christ over all other creatures (
Eph 1:19
–
21
) and in appointing him
head
of the church (
Eph 1:22
–
23
). For the allusion to angelic spirits in
Eph 1:21
, see
Rom 8:38
and
Col 1:16
. Here, as in
1 Cor 15:24
–
25
and
Col 2:15
, every such
principality
and
power
is made subject to Christ.
* [
1:15
]
Your faith…your love
: some manuscripts omit the latter phrase, but cf.
Col 1:4
.
* [
1:23
]
His body
: the church (
Eph 1:22
); cf. note on
Col 1:18
. Only in Ephesians and Colossians is Christ the
head
of the
body
, in contrast to the view in
1 Cor 12
and
Rom 12:4
–
8
where Christ is equated with the entire body or community.
Fullness
: see note on
Col 1:19
. Some take
the one who fills
as God, others as Christ (cf.
Eph 4:10
). If in Christ “dwells the fullness of the deity bodily” (
Col 2:9
), then, as God “fills” Christ, Christ in turn fills the church and the believer (
Eph 3:19
;
5:18
). But the difficult phrases here may also allow the church to be viewed as the “complement” of Christ who is “being filled” as God’s plan for the universe is carried out through the church (cf.
Eph 3:9
–
10
).
