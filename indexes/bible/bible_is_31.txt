CHAPTER 31
Against the Egyptian Alliance
1
Ah! Those who go down to Egypt for help,
who rely on horses;
Who put their trust in chariots because of their number,
and in horsemen because of their combined power,
But look not to the Holy One of Israel
nor seek the L
ORD
!
*
a
2
Yet he too is wise and will bring disaster;
he will not turn from his threats.
He will rise up against the house of the wicked
and against those who help evildoers.
b
3
The Egyptians are human beings, not God,
their horses flesh, not spirit;
When the L
ORD
stretches forth his hand,
the helper shall stumble, the one helped shall fall,
and both of them shall perish together.
c
4
For thus says the L
ORD
to me:
As a lion or its young
growling over the prey,
With a band of shepherds
assembled against it,
Is neither dismayed by their shouts
nor cowed by their noise,
So shall the L
ORD
of hosts come down
to wage war upon Mount Zion, upon its height.
d
5
Like hovering birds, so the L
ORD
of hosts
shall shield Jerusalem,
To shield and deliver,
to spare and rescue.
e
6
Return, O Israelites, to him whom you have utterly deserted.
f
7
On that day each one of you shall reject his idols of silver and gold, which your hands have made.
g
8
Assyria shall fall by a sword, not wielded by human being,
no mortal sword shall devour him;
He shall flee before the sword,
and his young men shall be impressed as laborers.
h
9
He shall rush past his crag
*
in panic,
and his princes desert the standard in terror,
Says the L
ORD
who has a fire in Zion
and a furnace in Jerusalem.
i
* [
31:1
]
Seek the L
ORD
: a technical expression for seeking a prophetic or priestly oracle, similar to the expression “asking my counsel” in
30:2
. The prophet complains that Judah has decided on its policy of alliance with Egypt without first consulting the Lord.
* [
31:9
]
Crag
: the king as the rallying point of the princes.
Panic
: terror is an element of Israel’s holy war tradition, in which defeat of the enemy is accomplished by the Lord rather than by human means (cf. v.
8
).
