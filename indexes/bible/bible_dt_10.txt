CHAPTER 10
1
a
At that time the L
ORD
said to me, Cut two stone tablets like the first ones
b
and come up the mountain to me. Also make an ark out of wood.
2
I will write upon the tablets the words that were on the tablets that you broke, and you shall place them in the ark.
3
So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
c
4
d
The L
ORD
then wrote on the tablets, as he had written before, the ten words
*
that the L
ORD
had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the L
ORD
gave them to me.
5
Then I turned and came down from the mountain, and placed the tablets in the ark I had made.
e
There they have remained, as the L
ORD
commanded me.
6
f
The Israelites set out from Beeroth Bene-jaakan for Moserah; Aaron died there and was buried. His son Eleazar succeeded him as priest.
g
7
From there they set out for Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah for Jotbathah, a region where there is water in the wadies.
8
At that time the L
ORD
set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the L
ORD
,
h
to stand before the L
ORD
to minister to him, and to bless in his name, as they have done to this day.
9
For this reason, Levi has no hereditary portion with his relatives;
i
the L
ORD
himself is his portion, as the L
ORD
, your God, promised him.
10
Meanwhile I stayed on the mountain as I did before, forty days and forty nights, and once again the L
ORD
listened to me. The L
ORD
was unwilling to destroy you.
11
The L
ORD
said to me, Go now and set out at the head of the people,
j
that they may enter in and possess the land that I swore to their ancestors I would give them.
The Lord’s Majesty and Compassion.
12
k
Now, therefore, Israel, what does the L
ORD
, your God, ask of you but to fear the L
ORD
, your God, to follow in all his ways, to love and serve the L
ORD
, your God, with your whole heart and with your whole being,
l
13
to keep the commandments and statutes of the L
ORD
that I am commanding you today for your own well-being?
m
14
Look, the heavens, even the highest heavens, belong to the L
ORD
, your God, as well as the earth and everything on it.
n
15
Yet only on your ancestors did the L
ORD
set his heart to love them. He chose you, their descendants, from all the peoples, as it is today.
o
16
Circumcise therefore the foreskins of your hearts,
*
and be stiff-necked no longer.
17
For the L
ORD
, your God, is the God of gods, the Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who has no favorites, accepts no bribes,
p
18
who executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and loves the resident alien, giving them food and clothing.
q
19
So you too should love the resident alien, for that is what you were in the land of Egypt.
r
20
The L
ORD
, your God, shall you fear, and him shall you serve; to him hold fast and by his name shall you swear.
s
21
He is your praise; he is your God, who has done for you those great and awesome things that your own eyes have seen.
t
22
Seventy strong your ancestors went down to Egypt,
u
and now the L
ORD
, your God, has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven.
* [
10:4

Ten words
: the ten commandments (cf.
4:13
).
* [
10:16
]
Circumcise therefore the foreskins of your hearts
: cf.
30:6
;
Jer 4:4
;
Rom 2:29
. The “uncircumcised heart” (
Lv 26:41
;
Jer 9:25
;
Ez 44:7
,
9
) is closed and unreceptive to God, just as “uncircumcised ears” (
Jer 6:10
) are closed to the word of the Lord, and “uncircumcised lips” (
Ex 6:12
,
30
) are a hindrance to speaking on behalf of the Lord.
