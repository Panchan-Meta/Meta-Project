CHAPTER 17
The Oracle of Nathan.
1
a
After David had taken up residence in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet, “See, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the L
ORD
is under tentcloth.”
b
2
Nathan replied to David, “Whatever is in your heart, go and do, for God is with you.”
3
But that same night the word of God came to Nathan:
4
Go and tell David my servant, Thus says the L
ORD
: It is not you who are to build the house for me to dwell in.
c
5
For I have never dwelt in a house, from the day I brought Israel up, even to this day, but I have been lodging in tent or tabernacle.
6
As long as I have wandered about with all Israel, did I ever say a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
7
Now then, speak thus to my servant David, Thus says the L
ORD
of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to become ruler over my people Israel.
d
8
I was with you wherever you went, and I cut down all your enemies before you. I will make your name like that of the greatest on the earth.
9
I will assign a place for my people Israel and I will plant them in it to dwell there; they will never again be disturbed, nor shall the wicked ever again oppress them, as they did at the beginning,
10
and during all the time when I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the L
ORD
will build you a house:
11
when your days have been completed and you must join your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you who will be one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
e
12
He it is who shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.
f
13
I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me, and I will not withdraw my favor from him as I withdrew it from the one who was before you;
g
14
but I will maintain him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be firmly established forever.
15
In accordance with all these words and this whole vision Nathan spoke to David.
David’s Thanksgiving.
16
Then King David came in and sat in the L
ORD
’s presence, and said: “Who am I, L
ORD
God, and what is my house, that you should have brought me so far?
17
And yet, even this is too little in your sight, O God! For you have made a promise regarding your servant’s house reaching into the future, and you have looked on me as henceforth the most notable of men, L
ORD
God.
h
18
What more can David say to you? You have known
*
your servant.
19
L
ORD
, for your servant’s sake and in keeping with your purpose, you have done this great thing.
20
L
ORD
, there is no one like you, no God but you, just as we have always heard.
i
21
“Is there, like your people Israel, whom you redeemed from Egypt, another nation on earth whom a god went to redeem as his people? You won for yourself a name for great and awesome deeds by driving out the nations before your people.
j
22
You made your people Israel your own forever, and you, L
ORD
, became their God.
23
Now, L
ORD
, may the promise that you have spoken concerning your servant and his house remain firm forever. Bring about what you have promised,
24
that your name, L
ORD
of hosts, God of Israel, may be great and abide forever, while the house of your servant is established in your presence.
25
“Because you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house, your servant dares to pray before you.
k
26
Since you, L
ORD
, are truly God and have made this generous promise to your servant,
27
do, then, bless the house of your servant, that it may be in your presence forever—since it is you, L
ORD
, who blessed it, it is blessed forever.”
