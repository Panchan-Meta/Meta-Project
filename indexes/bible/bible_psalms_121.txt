PSALM 121
*
The Lord My Guardian
1
A song of ascents.
I raise my eyes toward the mountains.
*
From whence shall come my help?
a
2
My help comes from the L
ORD
,
the maker of heaven and earth.
b
3
He will not allow your foot to slip;
c
or your guardian to sleep.
4
Behold, the guardian of Israel
never slumbers nor sleeps.
5
*
The L
ORD
is your guardian;
the L
ORD
is your shade
at your right hand.
d
6
By day the sun will not strike you,
nor the moon by night.
e
7
The L
ORD
will guard you from all evil;
he will guard your soul.
f
8
The L
ORD
will guard your coming and going
both now and forever.

* [
Psalm 121
] A blessing given to someone embarking on a dangerous journey whether a soldier going on a campaign or a pilgrim returning home from the Temple. People look anxiously at the wooded hills. Will God protect them on their journey (
Ps 121:1
)? The speaker declares that God is not confined to a place or a time (
Ps 121:2
), that every step is guarded (
Ps 121:3
–
4
); night and day (
Ps 121:5
–
6
) God watches over their every movement (
Ps 121:7
–
8
).
* [
121:1
]
The mountains
: possibly Mount Zion, the site of the Temple and hence of safety, but more probably mountains as a place of dangers, causing anxiety to the psalmist.
* [
121:5
–
6
] The image of shade, a symbol of protection, is apt: God as shade protects from the harmful effects that ancients believed were caused by the sun and moon.
