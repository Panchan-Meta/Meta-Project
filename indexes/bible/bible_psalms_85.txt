PSALM 85
*
Prayer for Divine Favor
1
For the leader. A psalm of the Korahites.
I
2
You once favored, L
ORD
, your land,
restored the captives of Jacob.
a
3
You forgave the guilt of your people,
pardoned all their sins.
Selah
4
You withdrew all your wrath,
turned back from your burning anger.
b
II
5
Restore us, God of our salvation;
let go of your displeasure with us.
c
6
Will you be angry with us forever,
prolong your anger for all generations?
d
7
Certainly you will again restore our life,
that your people may rejoice in you.
8
Show us, L
ORD
, your mercy;
grant us your salvation.
III
9
*
I will listen for what God, the L
ORD
, has to say;
surely he will speak of peace
To his people and to his faithful.
May they not turn to foolishness!
10
Near indeed is his salvation for those who fear him;
glory will dwell in our land.
11
*
Love and truth will meet;
justice and peace will kiss.
e
12
Truth will spring from the earth;
justice will look down from heaven.
f
13
Yes, the L
ORD
will grant his bounty;
our land will yield its produce.
g
14
Justice will march before him,
and make a way for his footsteps.
* [
Psalm 85
] A national lament reminding God of past favors and forgiveness (
Ps 85:2
–
4
) and begging for forgiveness and grace now (
Ps 85:5
–
8
). A speaker represents the people who wait humbly with open hearts (
Ps 85:9
–
10
): God will be active on their behalf (
Ps 85:11
–
13
). The situation suggests the conditions of Judea during the early postexilic period, the fifth century B.C.; the thoughts are similar to those of postexilic prophets (
Hg 1:5
–
11
;
2:6
–
9
).
* [
85:9
] The prophet listens to God’s revelation, cf.
Heb 2:1
.
* [
85:11
–
13
] Divine activity is personified as pairs of virtues.
