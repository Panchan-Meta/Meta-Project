PSALM 126
*
The Reversal of Zion’s Fortunes
1
A song of ascents.
I
When the L
ORD
restored the captives of Zion,
a
we thought we were dreaming.
2
Then our mouths were filled with laughter;
our tongues sang for joy.
b
Then it was said among the nations,
“The L
ORD
had done great things for them.”
3
The L
ORD
has done great things for us;
Oh, how happy we were!
4
Restore our captives, L
ORD
,
like the dry stream beds of the Negeb.
*
II
5
Those who sow in tears
will reap with cries of joy.
c
6
Those who go forth weeping,
carrying sacks of seed,
Will return with cries of joy,
carrying their bundled sheaves.
* [
Psalm 126
] A lament probably sung shortly after Israel’s return from exile. The people rejoice that they are in Zion (
Ps 126:1
–
3
) but mere presence in the holy city is not enough; they must pray for the prosperity and the fertility of the land (
Ps 126:4
). The last verses are probably an oracle of promise: the painful work of sowing will be crowned with life (
Ps 126:5
–
6
).
* [
126:4
]
Like the dry stream beds of the Negeb
: the psalmist prays for rain in such abundance that the dry riverbeds will run.
