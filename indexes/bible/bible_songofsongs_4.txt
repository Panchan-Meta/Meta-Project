CHAPTER 4
The Beauty of the Woman
1
M
a
,
b
How beautiful you are, my friend,
how beautiful you are!
Your eyes are doves
behind your veil.
Your hair is like a flock of goats
streaming down Mount Gilead.
*
2
Your teeth
*
are like a flock of ewes to be shorn,
that come up from the washing,
All of them big with twins,
none of them barren.
3
Like a scarlet strand, your lips,
and your mouth—lovely!
Like pomegranate
*
halves, your cheeks
behind your veil.
4
c
Like a tower of David, your neck,
built in courses,
A thousand shields hanging upon it,
all the armor of warriors.
*
5
d
Your breasts are like two fawns,
twins of a gazelle
feeding among the lilies.
6
e
Until the day grows cool
and the shadows flee,
I shall go to the mountain of myrrh,
to the hill of frankincense.
*
7
You are beautiful in every way, my friend,
there is no flaw in you!
*
8
With me from Lebanon, my bride!
With me from Lebanon, come!
Descend from the peak of Amana,
from the peak of Senir and Hermon,
*
From the lairs of lions,
from the leopards’ heights.
9
f
You have ravished my heart, my sister,
*
my bride;
you have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes,
with one bead of your necklace.
10
g
How beautiful is your love,
my sister, my bride,
How much better is your love than wine,
and the fragrance of your perfumes than any spice!
11
Your lips drip honey,
*
my bride,
honey and milk are under your tongue;
And the fragrance of your garments
is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
The Lover’s Garden
12
M
h
A garden enclosed, my sister, my bride,
a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed!
*
13
Your branches are a grove of pomegranates,
with fruits of choicest yield:
Henna with spikenard,
14
spikenard and saffron,
Sweet cane and cinnamon,
with all kinds of frankincense;
Myrrh and aloes,
with all the finest spices;
*
15
A garden fountain, a well of living water,
streams flowing from Lebanon.
16
Awake,
*
north wind!
Come, south wind!
Blow upon my garden
that its perfumes may spread abroad.
W
Let my lover come to his garden
and eat its fruits of choicest yield.
