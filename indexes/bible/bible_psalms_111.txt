PSALM 111
*
Praise of God for Goodness to Israel
1
Hallelujah!
I will praise the L
ORD
with all my heart
a
in the assembled congregation of the upright.
*
2
Great are the works of the L
ORD
,
studied by all who delight in them.
3
Majestic and glorious is his work,
his righteousness endures forever.
4
He won renown for his wondrous deeds;
gracious and merciful is the L
ORD
.
b
5
He gives food to those who fear him,
*
he remembers his covenant forever.
6
He showed his powerful deeds to his people,
giving them the inheritance of the nations.
7
The works of his hands are true and just,
reliable all his decrees,
8
Established forever and ever,
to be observed with truth and equity.
9
He sent release to his people,
decreed his covenant forever;
holy and fearsome is his name.
10
*
The fear of the L
ORD
is the beginning of wisdom;
c
prudent are all who practice it.
His praise endures forever.
* [
Psalm 111
] A Temple singer (
Ps 111:1
) tells how God is revealed in Israel’s history (
Ps 111:2
–
10
). The deeds reveal God’s very self, powerful, merciful, faithful. The poem is an acrostic, each verse beginning with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
* [
111:1
]
In the assembled congregation of the upright
: in the Temple, cf.
Ps 149:1
.
* [
111:5
]
Food to those who fear him
: probably a reference to the manna in the desert, which elsewhere is seen as a type of the Eucharist, cf.
Jn 6:31
–
33
,
49
–
51
.
* [
111:10
]
The fear of the L
ORD
: reverence for God.
