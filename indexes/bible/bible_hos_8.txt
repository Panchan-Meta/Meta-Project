CHAPTER 8
Corruption of Cult, Domestic and Foreign Politics
1
Put the trumpet to your lips!
a
One like an eagle
*
is over the house of the L
ORD
!
Because they have violated my covenant,
and rebelled against my law,
2
They cry out to me,
“My God! We know you!”
3
But Israel has rejected what is good;
the enemy
*
shall pursue him.
4
*
They made kings, but not by my authority;
they established princes, but without my knowledge.
With their silver and gold
they made idols for themselves,
to their own destruction.
5
He has rejected your calf,
*
Samaria!
b
My wrath is kindled against them;
How long will they be incapable of innocence
in Israel?
6
An artisan made it,
it is no god at all.
c
The calf of Samaria
will be dashed to pieces.
7
When they sow the wind,
they will reap the whirlwind;
d
The stalk of grain that forms no head
can yield no flour;
Even if it could,
strangers would swallow it.
8
Israel is swallowed up;
now they are among the nations,
like a useless vessel.
9
For they went up to Assyria—
*
a wild ass off on its own—
Ephraim bargained for lovers.
e
10
Even though they bargain with the nations,
I will now gather them
*
together;
They will soon succumb
under the burden of king and princes.
11
*
When Ephraim made many altars to expiate sin,
they became altars for sinning.
12
Though I write for him my many instructions,
they are considered like a stranger’s.
13
They love sacrifice,
they sacrifice meat and eat it,
but the L
ORD
is not pleased with them.
f
Now he will remember their guilt
and punish their sins;
g
they shall return to Egypt.
*
h
14
Israel has forgotten his maker
i
and has built palaces.
Judah, too, has fortified many cities,
but I will send fire upon his cities,
to devour their strongholds.

Eagle
: perhaps an image for Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria, who overran the land of Israel in 733 B.C. (
Jer 48:40
;
49:22
;
Ez 17:3
).
* [
8:3
]
Enemy
: Assyria.
* [
8:4
] Hosea is not against the monarchy, but against the conspiracies at the royal court (see note on
7:3
–
7
). The king should be chosen by God (
1 Kgs 19:15
–
16
).
* [
8:5
]
Calf
: a cultic object introduced by Jeroboam I after the separation of the Northern Kingdom from the Southern Kingdom (
1 Kgs 12:26
–
30
; cf.
Ex 32
).
* [
8:9
]
They went up to Assyria
: a reference to the politics of appealing to Assyria (cf.
5:13
;
7:11
). There is a play on the Hebrew word for “wild ass” (
pere
) and “Ephraim.”
* [
8:10
]
I will now gather them
: for judgment and for deportation.
* [
8:11
] The altars had become places of self-serving worship (cf. v.
13
).
* [
8:13
]
Return to Egypt
: to punish their violation of the covenant they will experience a reversal of the exodus.
