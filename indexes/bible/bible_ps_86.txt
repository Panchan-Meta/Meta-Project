PSALM 86
*
Prayer in Time of Distress
1
A prayer of David.
I
Incline your ear, L
ORD
, and answer me,
for I am poor and oppressed.
2
Preserve my life, for I am devoted;
save your servant who trusts in you.
You are my God;
3
be gracious to me, Lord;
to you I call all the day.
4
Gladden the soul of your servant;
to you, Lord, I lift up my soul.
a
5
Lord, you are good and forgiving,
most merciful to all who call on you.
b
6
L
ORD
, hear my prayer;
listen to my cry for help.
c
7
On the day of my distress I call to you,
for you will answer me.
II
8
None among the gods can equal you, O Lord;
nor can their deeds compare to yours.
d
9
All the nations you have made shall come
to bow before you, Lord,
and give honor to your name.
e
10
For you are great and do wondrous deeds;
and you alone are God.
III
11
Teach me, L
ORD
, your way
that I may walk in your truth,
f
single-hearted and revering your name.
12
I will praise you with all my heart,
glorify your name forever, Lord my God.
13
Your mercy to me is great;
you have rescued me from the depths of Sheol.
g
14
O God, the arrogant have risen against me;
a ruthless band has sought my life;
to you they pay no heed.
15
But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God,
slow to anger, abounding in mercy and truth.
h
16
Turn to me, be gracious to me;
give your strength to your servant;
save the son of your handmaid.
i
17
Give me a sign of your favor:
make my enemies see, to their confusion,
that you, L
ORD
, help and comfort me.
