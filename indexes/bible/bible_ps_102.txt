PSALM 102
*
Prayer in Time of Distress
1
The prayer of one afflicted and wasting away whose anguish is poured out before the L
ORD
.
I
2
L
ORD
, hear my prayer;
let my cry come to you.
3
Do not hide your face from me
in the day of my distress.
a
Turn your ear to me;
when I call, answer me quickly.
4
For my days vanish like smoke;
b
my bones burn away as in a furnace.
5
My heart is withered, dried up like grass,
too wasted to eat my food.
6
From my loud groaning
I become just skin and bones.
7
I am like a desert owl,
like an owl among the ruins.
8
I lie awake and moan,
like a lone sparrow on the roof.
9
All day long my enemies taunt me;
in their rage, they make my name a curse.
*
10
I eat ashes like bread,
mingle my drink with tears.
c
11
Because of your furious wrath,
you lifted me up just to cast me down.
12
d
My days are like a lengthening shadow;
e
I wither like the grass.
II
13
But you, L
ORD
, are enthroned forever;
your renown is for all generations.
f
14
You will again show mercy to Zion;
now is the time for pity;
the appointed time has come.
15
Its stones are dear to your servants;
its dust moves them to pity.
16
The nations shall fear your name, L
ORD
,
all the kings of the earth, your glory,
g
17
Once the L
ORD
has rebuilt Zion
and appeared in glory,
18
Heeding the plea of the lowly,
not scorning their prayer.
19
Let this be written for the next generation,
for a people not yet born,
that they may praise the L
ORD
:
h
20
*
“The L
ORD
looked down from the holy heights,
viewed the earth from heaven,
i
21
To attend to the groaning of the prisoners,
to release those doomed to die.”
j
22
Then the L
ORD
’s name will be declared on Zion,
his praise in Jerusalem,
23
When peoples and kingdoms gather
to serve the L
ORD
.
k
III
24
He has shattered my strength in mid-course,
has cut short my days.
25
I plead, O my God,
do not take me in the midst of my days.
*
l
Your years last through all generations.
26
Of old you laid the earth’s foundations;
m
the heavens are the work of your hands.
27
They perish, but you remain;
they all wear out like a garment;
Like clothing you change them and they are changed,
28
but you are the same, your years have no end.
29
May the children of your servants live on;
may their descendants live in your presence.

* [
Psalm 102
] A lament, one of the Penitential Psalms. The psalmist, experiencing psychological and bodily disintegration (
Ps 102:4
–
12
), cries out to God (
Ps 102:1
–
3
). In the Temple precincts where God has promised to be present, the psalmist recalls God’s venerable promises to save the poor (
Ps 102:13
–
23
). The final part (
Ps 102:24
–
28
) restates the original complaint and prayer, and emphasizes God’s eternity.
* [
102:9
]
They make my name a curse
: enemies use the psalmist’s name in phrases such as, “May you be as wretched as this person!”
* [
102:20
–
23
] Both
Ps 102:20
–
21
and
Ps 102:22
–
23
depend on
Ps 102:19
.
