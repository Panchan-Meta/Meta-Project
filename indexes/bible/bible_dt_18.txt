CHAPTER 18
Priests.
1
The levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no hereditary portion with Israel; they shall eat the fire offerings of the L
ORD
and the portions due to him.
a
2
They shall have no heritage among their kindred; the L
ORD
himself is their heritage, as he has told them.
b
3
This shall be the due of the priests from the people: those who are offering a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep, shall give the priest the shoulder, the jowls and the stomach.
4
The first fruits of your grain, your wine, and your oil,
c
as well as the first shearing of your flock, you shall also give him.
5
For the L
ORD
, your God, has chosen him out of all your tribes to be in attendance to minister in the name of the L
ORD
, him and his descendants for all time.
d
6
When a Levite goes from one of your communities anywhere in Israel in which he has been residing, to visit, as his heart may desire, the place which the L
ORD
will choose,
7
and ministers there in the name of the L
ORD
, his God, like all his fellow Levites who stand before the L
ORD
there,
8
he shall receive the same portions to eat, along with his stipends and patrimony.
*
Prophets.
9
When you come into the land which the L
ORD
, your God, is giving you, you shall not learn to imitate the abominations of the nations there.
e
10
f
Let there not be found among you anyone who causes their son or daughter to pass through the fire,
*
or practices divination, or is a soothsayer, augur, or sorcerer,
11
or who casts spells, consults ghosts and spirits, or seeks oracles from the dead.
12
Anyone who does such things is an abomination to the L
ORD
, and because of such abominations the L
ORD
, your God, is dispossessing them before you.
g
13
You must be altogether sincere with the L
ORD
, your God.
14
Although these nations whom you are about to dispossess listen to their soothsayers and diviners, the L
ORD
, your God, will not permit you to do so.
15
A prophet like me
*
will the L
ORD
, your God, raise up for you from among your own kindred; that is the one to whom you shall listen.
h
16
This is exactly what you requested of the L
ORD
, your God, at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, “Let me not again hear the voice of the L
ORD
, my God, nor see this great fire any more, or I will die.”
i
17
And the L
ORD
said to me, What they have said is good.
18
I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their kindred, and will put my words into the mouth of the prophet; the prophet shall tell them all that I command.
j
19
Anyone who will not listen to my words which the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will hold accountable for it.
k
20
But if a prophet presumes to speak a word in my name
l
that I have not commanded, or speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.
21
Should you say to yourselves, “How can we recognize that a word is one the L
ORD
has not spoken?”,
22
if a prophet speaks in the name of the L
ORD
but the word does not come true, it is a word the L
ORD
did not speak. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; do not fear him.

His stipends and patrimony
: meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
* [

Causes their son or daughter to pass through the fire
: to Molech. See note on
Lv 18:21
. Such human sacrifices are classed here with various occult and magical practices because they were believed to possess powers for averting a calamity; cf.
2 Kgs 3:27
. Three other categories of magic are listed here: divination of the future (by a soothsayer or augur); black magic (by a sorcerer or one who casts spells); and necromancy (by one who consults ghosts and spirits, or seeks oracles from the dead to divine the future).
* [

A prophet like me
: from the context (opposition to the practices described in vv.
10
–
11
) it seems that Moses is referring in general to all the true prophets who were to succeed him. This passage came to be understood in a quasi-Messianic sense in the New Testament (
Mt 17:5
;
Jn 6:14
;
7:40
;
Acts 3:22
;
