CHAPTER 6
The Lost Lover Found
1
D
Where has your lover gone,
most beautiful among women?
Where has your lover withdrawn
that we may seek him with you?
*
2
W
a
My lover has come down to his garden,
*
to the beds of spices,
To feed in the gardens
and to gather lilies.
3
b
I belong to my lover, and my lover belongs to me;
he feeds among the lilies.
The Beauty of the Woman
4
M
Beautiful as Tirzah are you, my friend;
*
fair as Jerusalem,
fearsome as celestial visions!
5
c
Turn your eyes away from me,
for they stir me up.
Your hair is like a flock of goats
streaming down from Gilead.
6
d
Your teeth are like a flock of ewes
that come up from the washing,
All of them big with twins,
none of them barren.
7
Like pomegranate halves,
your cheeks behind your veil.
8
Sixty are the queens, eighty the concubines,
and young women without number—
9
One alone
*
is my dove, my perfect one,
her mother’s special one,
favorite of the one who bore her.
Daughters see her and call her happy,
queens and concubines, and they praise her:
10
e
“Who
*
is this that comes forth like the dawn,
beautiful as the white moon, pure as the blazing sun,
fearsome as celestial visions?”
Love’s Meeting
11
W
f
To the walnut grove
*
I went down,
to see the young growth of the valley;
To see if the vines were in bloom,
if the pomegranates had blossomed.
12
Before I knew it, my desire had made me
the blessed one of the prince’s people.
*
* [
6:1
] The Daughters of Jerusalem are won by this description of the lover and offer their aid in seeking him (cf.
5:6
,
9
).
* [
6:2
–
3
] The woman implies here that she had never really lost her lover, for he has come down to his garden (cf.
2:16
;
4:5
).
Feed…lilies
: the imagery here evokes both a shepherd pasturing his flocks and erotic play between the lovers (
2:16
;
4:5
,
12
,
16
).
* [
6:4
–
9
] The man again celebrates the woman’s beauty.
Tirzah
: probably meaning “pleasant”; it was the early capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel (
1 Kgs 16
).
Celestial visions
: the meaning is uncertain. Military images may be implied here, i.e., the “heavenly hosts” who fight along with God on Israel’s behalf (cf.
Jgs 5:20
), or perhaps a reference to the awesome goddesses of the region who combined aspects of both fertility and war.
* [
6:9
]
One alone
: the incomparability of the woman is a favorite motif in love poetry.
* [
6:10
]
“Who…”
: the speakers may be the women of vv.
8
–
9
.
Moon…sun
: lit., “the white” and “the hot,” respectively (cf.
Is 24:23
;
30:26
).
Fearsome
: see note on
6:4
–
9
.
* [
6:11
]
Walnut grove
: also a site of activity in a wedding hymn of the Syrian moon goddess Nikkal (cf. the woman compared to the moon in v.
10
).
* [
6:12
] The text is obscure in Hebrew and in the ancient versions. The Vulgate reads: “I did not know; my soul disturbed me because of the chariots of Aminadab.” Based on a parallel in
Jgs 5:24
, “chariots” is here emended to “blessed one.”
