CHAPTER 1
Exhortation to Righteousness, the Key to Life
1
Love righteousness,
*
you who judge the earth;
a
think of the L
ORD
in goodness,
and seek him in integrity of heart;
b
2
Because he is found by those who do not test him,
and manifests himself to those who do not disbelieve him.
c
3
For perverse counsels separate people from God,
and his power, put to the proof, rebukes the foolhardy;
d
4
*
Because into a soul that plots evil wisdom does not enter,
nor does she dwell in a body under debt of sin.
e
5
For the holy spirit of discipline
*
flees deceit
and withdraws from senseless counsels
and is rebuked when unrighteousness occurs.
f
6
For wisdom is a kindly spirit,
yet she does not acquit blasphemous lips;
Because God is the witness of the inmost self
g
and the sure observer of the heart
and the listener to the tongue.
h
7
For the spirit of the L
ORD
fills the world,
i
is all-embracing, and knows whatever is said.
8
Therefore those who utter wicked things will not go unnoticed,
nor will chastising condemnation pass them by.
j
9
For the devices of the wicked shall be scrutinized,
and the sound of their words shall reach the L
ORD
,
for the chastisement of their transgressions;
10
Because a jealous ear hearkens to everything,
k
and discordant grumblings are not secret.
11
Therefore guard against profitless grumbling,
and from calumny
*
withhold your tongues;
For a stealthy utterance will not go unpunished,
and a lying mouth destroys the soul.
12
Do not court death
*
by your erring way of life,
nor draw to yourselves destruction by the works of your hands.
13
Because God did not make death,
l
nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living.
14
For he fashioned all things that they might have being,
and the creatures of the world are wholesome;
There is not a destructive drug among them
nor any domain of Hades
*
on earth,
15
For righteousness is undying.
*
m
The Wicked Reject Immortality and Righteousness Alike
16
It was the wicked who with hands and words invited death,
considered it a friend, and pined for it,
and made a covenant with it,
Because they deserve to be allied with it.
n
* [
1:1
–
6:21
] The reward is the gift of immortality, to the righteous (
1:15
;
3:1
–
3
), but not to the wicked (
5:1
–
13
). Contrasts between these two groups dominate chaps.
1
–
5
. The philosophy of the wicked and their persecution of the righteous are dramatically presented in
1:16
–
2:24
. New light is shed on the suffering of the righteous (
3:1
–
9
), childlessness (
3:13
–
15
), and premature death (
4:7
–
16
)—in contrast to the fate of the wicked (
3:10
–
12
,
16
–
19
;
4:3
–
6
,
17
–
20
).
* [
1:1
]
Righteousness
: not merely the cardinal virtue of justice (cf.
8:7
), but the universal moral quality which is the application of wisdom to moral conduct.
You who judge
: “judges” and “kings” (cf.
6:1
) are addressed in accordance with the literary customs of the times and with the putative Solomonic authorship, but the real audience is the Jewish community.
* [
1:4
] In these verses personified Wisdom is identified with the spirit of the Lord; so also in
9:17
.
* [
1:5
]
Discipline
: here and elsewhere, another name for Wisdom.
* [
1:11
]
Calumny
: speech against God and divine providence is meant.
* [
1:12
]
Death
: as will become clear, the author is not speaking of physical death but of spiritual death, the eternal separation from God.
* [
1:14
]
Hades
: the Greek term for the Hebrew Sheol, the dwelling place of the dead.
* [
1:15
]
Undying
: immortality is not seen as an innate quality of the soul but as a gift of God to the righteous.
