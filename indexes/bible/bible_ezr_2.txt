58
The total of the temple servants together with the descendants of Solomon’s servants was three hundred and ninety-two.
59
The following who returned from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer were unable to prove that their ancestral houses and their descent were Israelite:
60
descendants of Delaiah, descendants of Tobiah, descendants of Nekoda, six hundred and fifty-two.
61
c
Also, of the priests: descendants of Habaiah, descendants of Hakkoz, descendants of Barzillai (he had married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was named after him).
62
These searched their family records, but their names could not be found there, and they were excluded from the priesthood.
63
d
The governor
*
ordered them not to partake of the most holy foods until there should be a priest to consult the Urim and Thummim.
64
The entire assembly taken together came to forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,
65
not counting their male and female servants, who numbered seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. They also had two hundred male and female singers.
66
Their horses numbered seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five,
67
their camels four hundred and thirty-five, their donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
68
When they arrived at the house of the L
ORD
in Jerusalem, some of the heads of ancestral houses made voluntary offerings for the house of God, to rebuild it in its place.
69
According to their means they contributed to the treasury for the temple service: sixty-one thousand drachmas of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly robes.
70
The priests, the Levites, and some of the people took up residence in Jerusalem; the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants settled in their cities. Thus all the Israelites settled in their cities.
* [
2:1
–
67
] As it now stands, this list, which also appears at
Neh 7:6
–
72
, is an expanded form of lists of Babylonian repatriates from the sixth century B.C. It served to establish membership in the reconstituted Temple community; civic status and perhaps also title to property depended on this membership.
* [
2:41
]
The singers
: the term covers the composition as well as the rendition of liturgical music. Since they are listed as distinct from Levites (
2:40
), they had not yet attained levitical status, as in Chronicles (e.g.,
1 Chr 9:33
–
34
;
23:3
–
6
).
* [
2:42
]
The gatekeepers
: their principal task was to protect the ritual purity of the temple area (e.g.,
2 Chr 23:19
). The author assumes that they were established by David as a distinct levitical category (
1 Chr 15:18
;
26:1
–
19
).
* [
2:63
]
The governor
: the honorific title was also held by Nehemiah (
Neh 8:9
;
10:2
). The identity of the governor is unknown; both Sheshbazzar (
Ezr 5:14
) and Zerubbabel (
Hg 1:1
,
14
;
2:2
,
21
) are identified as governors of Judah in the early Persian period.
Mal 1:8
refers to an unnamed governor, and the names of other occupants of the office (Yehoezer, Ahzai, Elnathan) occur on seal impressions, though their date is uncertain.
