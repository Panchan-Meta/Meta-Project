CHAPTER 16
Birth of Ishmael.
*
1
Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no children. Now she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.
a
2
Sarai said to Abram: “The L
ORD
has kept me from bearing children. Have intercourse with my maid; perhaps I will have sons through her.” Abram obeyed Sarai.
*
b
3
Thus, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, his wife Sarai took her maid, Hagar the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
4
He had intercourse with her, and she became pregnant. As soon as Hagar knew she was pregnant, her mistress lost stature in her eyes.
*
c
5
d
So Sarai said to Abram: “This outrage against me is your fault. I myself gave my maid to your embrace; but ever since she knew she was pregnant, I have lost stature in her eyes. May the L
ORD
decide between you and me!”
6
Abram told Sarai: “Your maid is in your power. Do to her what you regard as right.” Sarai then mistreated her so much that Hagar ran away from her.
7
The L
ORD
’s angel
*
found her by a spring in the wilderness, the spring on the road to Shur,
e
8
and he asked, “Hagar, maid of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She answered, “I am running away from my mistress, Sarai.”
9
But the L
ORD
’s angel told her: “Go back to your mistress and submit to her authority.
10
I will make your descendants so numerous,” added the L
ORD
’s angel, “that they will be too many to count.”
f
11
Then the L
ORD
’s angel said to her:
“You are now pregnant and shall bear a son;
you shall name him Ishmael,
*
For the L
ORD
has heeded your affliction.
12
He shall be a wild ass of a man,
his hand against everyone,
and everyone’s hand against him;
Alongside
*
all his kindred
shall he encamp.”
g
13
To the L
ORD
who spoke to her she gave a name, saying, “You are God who sees me”;
*
she meant, “Have I really seen God and remained alive after he saw me?”
h
14
That is why the well is called Beer-lahai-roi.
*
It is between Kadesh and Bered.
15
Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram named the son whom Hagar bore him Ishmael.
i
16
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
* [
16:1
–
16
] In the previous chapter Abraham was given a timetable of possession of the land, but nothing was said about when the child was to be born. In this chapter, Sarah takes matters into her own hands, for she has been childless ten years since the promise (cf.
12:4
with
16:16
). The story is about the two women, Sarah the infertile mistress and Hagar the fertile slave; Abraham has only a single sentence. In the course of the story, God intervenes directly on the side of Hagar, for she is otherwise without resources.
* [
16:2
] The custom of an infertile wife providing her husband with a concubine to produce children is widely attested in ancient Near Eastern law; e.g., an Old Assyrian marriage contract states that the wife must provide her husband with a concubine if she does not bear children within two years.
* [
16:4
] Because barrenness was at that time normally blamed on the woman and regarded as a disgrace, it is not surprising that Hagar looks down on Sarah. Ancient Near Eastern legal practice addresses such cases of insolent slaves and allows disciplining of them.
Prv 30:23
uses as an example of intolerable behavior “a maidservant when she ousts her mistress.”
* [
16:7
]
The L
ORD
’s angel
: a manifestation of God in human form; in v.
13
the messenger is identified with God. See note on
Ex 3:2
.
* [
16:11
]
Ishmael
: in Hebrew the name means “God has heard.” It is the same Hebrew verb that is translated “heeded” in the next clause. In other ancient Near Eastern texts, the name commemorated the divine answer to the parents’ prayer to have a child, but here it is broadened to mean that God has “heard” Hagar’s plight. In vv.
13
–
14
, the verb “to see” is similarly broadened to describe God’s special care for those in need.
* [
16:12
]
Alongside
: lit., “against the face of”; the same phrase is used of the lands of Ishmael’s descendants in
25:18
. It can be translated “in opposition to” (
Dt 21:16
;
Jb 1:11
;
6:28
;
21:31
), but here more likely means that Ishmael’s settlement was near but not in the promised land.
* [
16:13
]
God who sees me
: Hebrew
el-ro’i
is multivalent, meaning either “God of seeing,” i.e., extends his protection to me, or “God sees,” which can imply seeing human suffering (
29:32
;
Ex 2:25
;
Is 57:18
;
58:3
). It is probable that Hagar means to express both of these aspects.
Remained alive
: for the ancient notion that a person died on seeing God, see
Gn 32:31
;
Ex 20:19
;
Dt 4:33
;
Jgs 13:22
.
* [
16:14
]
Beer-lahai-roi
: possible translations of the name of the well include: “spring of the living one who sees me”; “the well of the living sight”; or “the one who sees me lives.” See note on v.
