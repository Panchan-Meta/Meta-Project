PSALM 115
*
The Greatness of the True God
I
1
Not to us, L
ORD
, not to us
but to your name give glory
because of your mercy and faithfulness.
a
2
Why should the nations say,
“Where is their God?”
*
b
3
Our God is in heaven
and does whatever he wills.
c
II
4
Their idols are silver and gold,
d
the work of human hands.
e
5
They have mouths but do not speak,
eyes but do not see.
6
They have ears but do not hear,
noses but do not smell.
7
They have hands but do not feel,
feet but do not walk;
they produce no sound from their throats.
8
Their makers will be like them,
and anyone who trusts in them.
III
9
*
The house of Israel trusts in the L
ORD
,
f
who is their help and shield.
g
10
The house of Aaron trusts in the L
ORD
,
who is their help and shield.
11
Those who fear the L
ORD
trust in the L
ORD
,
who is their help and shield.
12
The L
ORD
remembers us and will bless us,
will bless the house of Israel,
will bless the house of Aaron,
13
Will bless those who fear the L
ORD
,
small and great alike.
14
May the L
ORD
increase your number,
yours and your descendants.
15
May you be blessed by the L
ORD
,
maker of heaven and earth.
16
*
The heavens belong to the L
ORD
,
but he has given the earth to the children of Adam.
h
17
*
The dead do not praise the L
ORD
,
not all those go down into silence.
i
18
It is we who bless the L
ORD
,
both now and forever.
Hallelujah!

Psalm 115
] A response to the enemy taunt, “Where is your God?” This hymn to the glory of Israel’s God (
Ps 115:1
–
3
) ridicules the lifeless idols of the nations (
Ps 115:4
–
8
), expresses in a litany the trust of the various classes of the people in God (
Ps 115:9
–
11
), invokes God’s blessing on them as they invoke the divine name (
Ps 115:12
–
15
), and concludes as it began with praise of God.
Ps 135:15
–
18
similarly mocks the Gentile gods and has a similar litany and hymn (
Ps 135:19
–
21
).
* [
115:2
]
Where is their God?
: implies that God cannot help them.
* [
115:9
–
11
]
The house of Israelâ€¦the house of Aaronâ€¦those who fear the L
ORD
: the laity of Israelite birth, the priests, and the converts to Judaism, cf.
Ps 118:2
–
4
;
135:19
–
21
. In the New Testament likewise “those who fear the Lord” means converts to Judaism (cf.
Acts 10:2
,
22
,
35
;
13:16
,
26
).
* [
115:16
]
The heavens
: the Septuagint reads here “the heaven of heavens” or “the highest heavens,” i.e., above the firmament. See note on
Ps 148:4
.

115:17
] See note on
Ps 6:5
