CHAPTER 4
Vision of Heavenly Worship.
*
1
After this I had a vision of an open door
*
to heaven, and I heard the trumpetlike voice that had spoken to me before, saying, “Come up here and I will show you what must happen afterwards.”
2
*
At once I was caught up in spirit.
a
A throne was there in heaven, and on the throne sat
3
one whose appearance sparkled like jasper and carnelian. Around the throne was a halo as brilliant as an emerald.
4
Surrounding the throne I saw twenty-four other thrones on which twenty-four elders
*
sat, dressed in white garments and with gold crowns on their heads.
b
5
From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder.
*
Seven flaming torches burned in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.
6
c
In front of the throne was something that resembled a sea of glass like crystal.
*
In the center and around the throne, there were four living creatures covered with eyes in front and in back.
7
The first creature resembled a lion, the second was like a calf, the third had a face like that of a human being, and the fourth looked like an eagle
*
in flight.
8
The four living creatures, each of them with six wings,
*
were covered with eyes inside and out. Day and night they do not stop exclaiming:
“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty,
who was, and who is, and who is to come.”
d
9
Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
10
the twenty-four elders fall down before the one who sits on the throne and worship him, who lives forever and ever. They throw down their crowns before the throne, exclaiming:
11
“Worthy are you, Lord our God,
to receive glory and honor and power,
for you created all things;
because of your will they came to be and were created.”

* [
4:1
–
11
] The seer now describes a vision of the heavenly court in worship of God enthroned. He reverently avoids naming or describing God but pictures twenty-four elders in priestly and regal attire (
Rev 4:4
) and God’s throne and its surroundings made of precious gems and other symbols that traditionally express the majesty of God (
Rev 4:5
–
6
). Universal creation is represented by the four living creatures (
Rev 4:6
–
7
). Along with the twenty-four elders, they praise God unceasingly in humble adoration (
Rev 4:8
–
11
).
* [
4:1
] The ancients viewed heaven as a solid vault, entered by way of actual doors.
* [
4:2
–
8
] Much of the imagery here is taken from
Ez 1
and
10
.
* [
4:4
]
Twenty-four elders
: these represent the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles; cf.
Rev 21:12
–

Flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder
: as in other descriptions of God’s appearance or activity; cf.

The seven spirits of God
: the seven “angels of the presence” as in
Rev 8:2
and
Tb 12:15
.
* [
4:6
]
A sea of glass like crystal
: an image adapted from
Ez 1:22
–
26
.
Four living creatures
: these are symbols taken from
Ez 1:5
–
21
; they are identified as cherubim in
Ez 10:20
.
Covered with eyes
: these suggest God’s knowledge and concern.
* [
4:7
]
Lion,calf,human being,eagle
: these symbolize, respectively, what is noblest, strongest, wisest, and swiftest in creation.
