PSALM 127
*
The Need of God’s Blessing
1
A song of ascents. Of Solomon.
I
Unless the L
ORD
build the house,
they labor in vain who build.
Unless the L
ORD
guard the city,
in vain does the guard keep watch.
2
It is vain for you to rise early
and put off your rest at night,
To eat bread earned by hard toil—
all this God gives to his beloved in sleep.
a
II
3
Certainly sons are a gift from the L
ORD
,
the fruit of the womb, a reward.
b
4
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior
are the sons born in one’s youth.
5
Blessed is the man who has filled his quiver with them.
He will never be shamed
for he will destroy his foes at the gate.

* [
Psalm 127
] The Psalm puts together two proverbs (
Ps 127:1
–
2
,
3
–
5
) on God establishing “houses” or families. The prosperity of human groups is not the work of human beings but the gift of God.
* [
127:5
]
At the gate
: the reference is not to enemies besieging the walls of a city but to adversaries in litigation. Law courts functioned in the open area near the main city gate. The more adult sons a man had, the more forceful he would appear in disputes, cf.
Prv 31:23
.
a. [
127:2
]
Eccl 2:24
.
b. [
127:3
]
Ps 115:14
;
128:3
;
Dt 28:11
;
Prv 17:6
.
