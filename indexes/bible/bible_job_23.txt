CHAPTER 23
Job’s Seventh Reply.
1
Then Job answered and said:
2
Today especially my complaint is bitter,
his hand is heavy upon me in my groanings.
3
Would that I knew how to find him,
that I might come to his dwelling!
4
I would set out my case before him,
fill my mouth with arguments;
5
I would learn the words he would answer me,
understand what he would say to me.
6
Would he contend against me with his great power?
No, he himself would heed me!
7
There an upright man might argue with him,
and I would once and for all be delivered from my judge.
8
But if I go east, he is not there;
*
or west, I cannot perceive him;
9
The north enfolds him, and I cannot catch sight of him;
The south hides him, and I cannot see him.
10
Yet he knows my way;
if he tested me, I should come forth like gold.
a
11
My foot has always walked in his steps;
I have kept his way and not turned aside.
12
From the commands of his lips I have not departed;
the words of his mouth I have treasured in my heart.
13
But once he decides, who can contradict him?
What he desires, that he does.
b
14
For he will carry out what is appointed for me,
and many such things he has in store.
15
Therefore I am terrified before him;
when I take thought, I dread him.
16
For it is God who has made my heart faint,
the Almighty who has terrified me.
17
Yes, would that I had vanished in darkness,
hidden by the thick gloom before me.

2
–

, contrary to his fears in
9:14

and

) gives way to his dark night: God’s absence (vv.

), which also terrifies (vv.

).
