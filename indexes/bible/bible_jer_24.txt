CHAPTER 24
The Two Baskets of Figs.
*
1
The L
ORD
showed me two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the L
ORD
.
a
This was after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had exiled from Jerusalem Jeconiah,
*
son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, the artisans and smiths, and brought them to Babylon.
2
One basket contained excellent figs, those that ripen early. But the other basket contained very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten.
3
Then the L
ORD
said to me: What do you see, Jeremiah?
b
“Figs,” I replied; “the good ones are very good, but the bad ones very bad, so bad they cannot be eaten.”
4
Thereupon this word of the L
ORD
came to me:
5
Thus says the L
ORD
, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, I will also regard with favor Judah’s exiles whom I sent away from this place into the land of the Chaldeans.
c
6
I will look after them for good and bring them back to this land, to build them up, not tear them down; to plant them, not uproot them.
d
7
I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the L
ORD
. They shall be my people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
e
8
But like the figs that are bad, so bad they cannot be eaten—yes, thus says the L
ORD
—even so will I treat Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his princes, the remnant of Jerusalem remaining in this land and those who have settled in the land of Egypt.
f
9
I will make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, a taunt and a curse, in all the places to which I will drive them.
g
10
I will send upon them sword, famine, and pestilence, until they have disappeared from the land which I gave them and their ancestors.

* [
24:1

10
] For Jeremiah, as for Ezekiel, no good could be expected from the people who had been left in Judah under Zedekiah or who had fled into Egypt; a future might be expected only for those who would pass through the purifying experience of the exile to form the new Israel.
