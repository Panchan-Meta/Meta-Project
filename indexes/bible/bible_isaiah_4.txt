CHAPTER 4
1
Seven women will take hold of one man
*
on that day, saying:
“We will eat our own food
and wear our own clothing;
Only let your name be given us,
put an end to our disgrace!”
Jerusalem Purified
2
*
On that day,
The branch
*
of the L
ORD
will be beauty and glory,
and the fruit of the land will be honor and splendor
for the survivors of Israel.
3
Everyone who remains in Zion,
everyone left in Jerusalem
Will be called holy:
everyone inscribed for life
*
in Jerusalem.
a
4
When the Lord washes away
the filth of the daughters of Zion,
And purges Jerusalem’s blood from her midst
with a blast of judgment, a searing blast,
b
5
Then will the L
ORD
create,
over the whole site of Mount Zion
and over her place of assembly,
A smoking cloud by day
and a light of flaming fire by night.
c
6
For over all, his glory will be shelter and protection:
shade from the parching heat of day,
refuge and cover from storm and rain.

Seven women…one man
: deportation (cf. note on
3:1
–
12
) would result in a disproportion of the sexes and leave the female population without enough male partners. The women are willing to marry, not for support, but to avoid disgrace.
* [
4:2
–

] Usually judged a later addition to the oracles of Isaiah. It relieves the threatening tone of the surrounding chaps.

Branch
: the term (Heb.
semah
) that is sometimes used of the ideal Davidic king of the future (cf.
Jer 23:5
;
33:15
;
Zec 3:8
;
6:12
). However, the parallel “fruit of the land” does not favor that usage here.

Inscribed for life
: in God’s list of the elect; cf.
Ex 32:32
