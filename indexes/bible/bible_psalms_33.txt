PSALM 33
*
Praise of God’s Power and Providence
I
1
Rejoice, you righteous, in the L
ORD
;
praise from the upright is fitting.
a
2
Give thanks to the L
ORD
on the harp;
on the ten-stringed lyre offer praise.
b
3
Sing to him a new song;
skillfully play with joyful chant.
4
For the L
ORD
’s word is upright;
all his works are trustworthy.
5
He loves justice and right.
The earth is full of the mercy of the L
ORD
.
c
II
6
By the L
ORD
’s word the heavens were made;
by the breath of his mouth all their host.
*
d
7
*
He gathered the waters of the sea as a mound;
he sets the deep into storage vaults.
e
III
8
Let all the earth fear the L
ORD
;
let all who dwell in the world show him reverence.
9
For he spoke, and it came to be,
commanded, and it stood in place.
f
10
The L
ORD
foils the plan of nations,
frustrates the designs of peoples.
11
But the plan of the L
ORD
stands forever,
the designs of his heart through all generations.
g
12
Blessed is the nation whose God is the L
ORD
,
the people chosen as his inheritance.
h
IV
13
From heaven the L
ORD
looks down
and observes the children of Adam,
i
14
From his dwelling place he surveys
all who dwell on earth.
15
The One who fashioned together their hearts
is the One who knows all their works.
V
16
A king is not saved by a great army,
nor a warrior delivered by great strength.
17
Useless is the horse for safety;
despite its great strength, it cannot be saved.
18
Behold, the eye of the L
ORD
is upon those who fear him,
upon those who count on his mercy,
19
To deliver their soul from death,
and to keep them alive through famine.
VI
20
Our soul waits for the L
ORD
,
he is our help and shield.
j
21
For in him our hearts rejoice;
in his holy name we trust.
22
May your mercy, L
ORD
, be upon us;
as we put our hope in you.

Psalm 33
] A hymn in which the just are invited (
Ps 33:1
–
3
) to praise God, who by a mere word (
Ps 33:4
–
5
) created the three-tiered universe of the heavens, the cosmic waters, and the earth (
Ps 33:6
–
9
). Human words, in contrast, effect nothing (
Ps 33:10
–
11
). The greatness of human beings consists in God’s choosing them as a special people and their faithful response (
Ps 33:12
–
22
).
* [
33:6
]
All their host
: the stars of the sky are commonly viewed as a vast army, e.g.,
Neh 9:6
;
Is 40:26
;
45:12
;
Jer 33:22
.
* [
33:7
]
The watersâ€¦as a mound
: ancients sometimes attributed the power keeping the seas from overwhelming land to a primordial victory of the storm-god over personified Sea.
