CHAPTER 3
Restoration of Worship.
1
a
Now when the seventh month
*
came, after the Israelites had settled in their cities, the people gathered as one in Jerusalem.
2
Then Jeshua, son of Jozadak, together with his kinsmen the priests, and Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, together with his kinsmen, began building the altar of the God of Israel in order to offer on it the burnt offerings prescribed in the law of Moses, the man of God.
3
b
They set the altar on its foundations, for they lived in fear of the peoples of the lands,
*
and offered burnt offerings to the L
ORD
on it, both morning and evening.
4
c
They also kept the feast of Booths in the manner prescribed, and they offered the daily burnt offerings in the proper number required for each day.
5
Thereafter they offered regular burnt offerings, the sacrifices prescribed for the new moons and all the festivals sacred to the L
ORD
, and those which anyone might bring as a voluntary offering to the L
ORD
.
Laying the Foundations of the Temple.
6
From the first day of the seventh month they reinstituted the burnt offering to the L
ORD
, though the foundation of the L
ORD
’s temple had not yet been laid.
7
d
Then they hired stonecutters and carpenters, and sent food and drink and oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians that they might ship cedar trees from the Lebanon to the port of Joppa, as Cyrus, king of Persia, had authorized.
8
In the year after their coming to the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, son of Jozadak, together with the rest of their kinsmen, the priests and Levites and all who had come from the captivity to Jerusalem, began by appointing the Levites twenty years of age and over to supervise the work on the house of the L
ORD
.
9
Jeshua and his sons and kinsmen, with Kadmiel and Binnui, son of Hodaviah, and their sons and their kindred, the Levites, together undertook to supervise those who were engaged in the work on the house of God.
10
e
While the builders were laying the foundation of the L
ORD
’s temple, the priests in their vestments were stationed with trumpets and the Levites, sons of Asaph, with cymbals to praise the L
ORD
in the manner laid down by David, king of Israel.
11
f
They alternated in songs of praise and thanksgiving to the L
ORD
, “for he is good, for his love for Israel endures forever”;
*
and all the people raised a great shout of joy, praising the L
ORD
because the foundation of the L
ORD
’s house had been laid.
12
g
Many of the priests, Levites, and heads of ancestral houses, who were old enough to have seen the former house, cried out in sorrow as they watched the foundation of the present house being laid. Many others, however, lifted up their voices in shouts of joy.
13
No one could distinguish the sound of the joyful shouting from the sound of those who were weeping; for the people raised a mighty clamor which was heard far away.

The seventh month
: Tishri (September–October), apparently of the first year of the return (538 B.C.), followed by events in the second year (v.
8
). In that case it was Sheshbazzar who laid the foundations of the Temple (
5:16
), and it was in the second year of Darius I (520 B.C.) that Jeshua and Zerubbabel resumed work on the Temple that had been temporarily interrupted (
Ezr 4:24
–
5:1
;
Hg 1:1
;
2:1
). The author, or a later editor, has set the construction and dedication of the Temple under Darius I back into the earliest period of the return. Shealtiel was the oldest son of King Jehoiachin (
1 Chr 3:17
–
19
); Zerubbabel was therefore Jehoiachin’s grandson; see note on
Ezr 1:8
.

Peoples of the lands
: referring either to those who had never left Judah or to neighboring peoples—Edomites, Arabs, inhabitants of Samaria—who opposed those who returned.
* [
3:11
]
“For he is good…forever”
: a refrain occurring frequently in liturgies of ancient Israel (cf.
Ps 136
).
