CHAPTER 23
Joshua’s Final Plea.
1
Many years later, after the L
ORD
had given the Israelites rest from all their enemies round about them, and when Joshua was old and advanced in years,
a
2
he summoned all Israel, including their elders, leaders, judges, and officers, and said to them: “I am old and advanced in years.
b
3
You have seen all that the L
ORD
, your God, has done for you against all these nations; for it has been the L
ORD
, your God, who fought for you.
4
c
See, I have apportioned among your tribes as their heritage the nations that survive, as well as those I destroyed, between the Jordan and the Great Sea in the west.
5
The L
ORD
, your God, will drive them out and dispossess them at your approach, so that you will take possession of their land as the L
ORD
, your God, promised you.
6
Therefore be strong and be careful to observe all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, never turning from it right or left,
d
7
or mingling with these nations that survive among you. You must not invoke their gods by name, or swear by them, or serve them, or bow down to them,
e
8
but you must hold fast to the L
ORD
, your God, as you have done up to this day.
9
At your approach the L
ORD
has dispossessed great and strong nations; not one has withstood you up to this day.
10
One of you puts to flight a thousand, because it is the L
ORD
, your God, himself who fights for you,
f
as he promised you.
11
As for you, take great care to love the L
ORD
, your God.
12
For if you ever turn away from him and join with the remnant of these nations that survive among you, by intermarrying and intermingling with them,
g
13
know for certain that the L
ORD
, your God, will no longer dispossess these nations at your approach. Instead they will be a snare and a trap for you, a scourge for your sides and thorns for your eyes, until you perish from this good land which the L
ORD
, your God, has given you.
h
14
“Today, as you see, I am going the way of all the earth.
*
So now acknowledge with your whole heart and soul that not one of all the promises the L
ORD
, your God, made concerning you has failed. Every one has come true for you; not one has failed.
15
i
But just as every promise the L
ORD
, your God, made to you has come true for you, so will he bring upon you every threat,
*
even so far as to exterminate you from this good land which the L
ORD
, your God, has given you.
16
If you transgress the covenant of the L
ORD
, your God, which he enjoined on you, to go and serve other gods and bow down to them, the anger of the L
ORD
will flare up against you and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you.”
